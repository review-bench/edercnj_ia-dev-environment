## 1. Service Info

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | my-quarkus-service |
| Version | `vX.Y.Z` |
| Environment | `production` |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` |

## 2. Pre-conditions

- [ ] All tests passing in CI
- [ ] Artifact built and published
- [ ] Configuration reviewed and updated
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards accessible


## 3. Deploy Procedure

### Step-by-step

1. Verify pre-conditions checklist above
2. Notify the team in the operations channel



### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Apply the new deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

# Monitor rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-quarkus-service

# Verify pods are running
kubectl get pods -l app=my-quarkus-service
```



3. Verify deployment status
4. Run post-deploy verification

## 4. Post-Deploy Verification

### Health Checks

- [ ] Application health endpoint returns `200 OK`
- [ ] All dependent services are reachable
- [ ] No error spikes in logs

### Smoke Tests

- [ ] Core business flow validated
- [ ] API responses match expected format
- [ ] Latency within acceptable thresholds

## 5. Rollback Procedure

### When to Rollback

- Health checks failing after deployment
- Error rate exceeds acceptable threshold
- Critical business flow broken

### Rollback Steps

1. Notify the team about rollback decision



### Kubernetes Rollback

```bash
# Undo the last deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-quarkus-service

# Verify rollback status
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-quarkus-service

# Confirm pods are running previous version
kubectl get pods -l app=my-quarkus-service
```




2. Verify rollback was successful
3. Investigate root cause

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pods not starting | Image pull error | Verify image tag and registry credentials |
| Health check failing | Application crash | Check application logs and configuration |
| High latency | Resource constraints | Scale up or check resource limits |
| Connection refused | Network policy | Verify service endpoints and network config |
