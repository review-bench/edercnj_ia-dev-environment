/**
 * Policy for skill output directory names that are owned by other assemblers and MUST never be

 *
 * <p>Extracted from {@code SkillsAssembler} (audit M-002) so the "which top-level names are
 * reserved" guardrail is a single-responsibility data class with its own test surface. Guarded
 * directories are written by classes earlier in the pipeline (RulesAssembler / CoreRulesWriter /
 * RulesConditionals) and their survival through a regeneration pass is a hard invariant validated
 * by {@link SkillsAssemblerPruneTest}.
 *
 * <p>The canonical reserved set is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code knowledge-packs/} — from {@code RulesInfraConditionals} (cloud / k8s / container
 *       reference files).
 *   <li>{@code database-patterns/} — from {@code RulesConditionals.copyDatabaseRefs} and {@code
 *       CoreKpRouting}. The database KP is not in the {@code SkillRegistry} 17-pack set; its
 *       content is sourced from {@code knowledge/databases/} and {@code
 *       knowledge/core/11-database-principles.md}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Other directories written by {@code CoreKpRouting} (e.g., {@code architecture/}, {@code
 * security/}, {@code testing/}) are already part of {@link dev.iadev.domain.stack.SkillRegistry}
 * {@code .CORE_KNOWLEDGE_PACKS}, so they appear in the generated set and do not need explicit
 * protection.
