# Skill: Architecture Plan Generator

## Purpose

Generates a comprehensive architecture plan for {{PROJECT_NAME}} with component diagrams, sequence diagrams, deployment topology, mini-ADRs, NFRs, and resilience/observability strategies. Use before implementation to document design decisions.

## Triggers

- `/x-plan-architecture STORY-ID` — generate architecture plan from story
- `/x-plan-architecture "Feature Name"` — generate from feature description
- `/x-plan-architecture ai/epics/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md` — generate from story file path

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Values | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `argument` | String | required | story ID, feature name, or file path | Source for architecture plan generation |

### Decision Tree

Evaluate the change scope to determine the plan level:

| Condition | Plan Level |
|-----------|-----------|
| New service / new integration / contract change / infra change | **Full** |
| New feature, no contract or infra change | **Simplified** |
| Bug fix / refactor / docs-only | **Skip** |

#### Full Architecture Plan

Apply when **any** of these conditions is true:

- New service or module being created
- New external integration (database, message broker, third-party API)
- Change to a public contract (REST API, gRPC proto, GraphQL schema, event schema)
- Infrastructure topology change (new container, new deployment target, new network policy)

#### Simplified Architecture Plan

Apply when:

- New feature in an existing service **without** contract or infrastructure changes
- Only affected sections are generated (skip unrelated diagrams)

#### Skip Architecture Plan

Apply when:

- Bug fix with no architectural impact
- Internal refactoring (no public API or contract change)
- Documentation-only change

## Workflow

```
1. PRE-CHECK  -> Verify idempotency (RULE-002)
2. TEMPLATE   -> Load template or use inline fallback (RULE-007)
3. READ       -> Read story/feature requirements
4. EVALUATE   -> Determine plan level (Full/Simplified/Skip)
5. CONTEXT    -> Read knowledge packs
6. REVIEW     -> Review existing architecture
7. GENERATE   -> Generate architecture plan document
8. VALIDATE   -> Verify section completeness
```

### Step 1 — Idempotency Pre-Check (RULE-002 — Idempotency)

Before generating an architecture plan, check whether one already exists and is still fresh.

#### Pre-Check Algorithm

```
1. Resolve the expected output path:
   ai/epics/epic-XXXX/plans/architecture-story-XXXX-YYYY.md

2. IF the file does NOT exist:
   - Log: "Generating architecture plan for {story}"
   - Proceed to generation

3. IF the file EXISTS:
   a. Compare modification times:
      - story_mtime = mtime of the story file
      - plan_mtime  = mtime of the architecture plan file
   b. IF story_mtime <= plan_mtime:
      - Log: "Reusing existing architecture plan from {date}"
      - STOP — do NOT regenerate
   c. IF story_mtime > plan_mtime:
      - Log: "Regenerating stale architecture plan for {story}"
      - Proceed to generation
```

#### Staleness Decision Table

| Condition | Action | Log Message |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Plan does not exist | Generate new | `Generating architecture plan for {story}` |
| Plan exists, story not modified | Reuse existing | `Reusing existing architecture plan from {date}` |
| Plan exists, story modified after plan | Regenerate | `Regenerating stale architecture plan for {story}` |

### Step 2 — Template Loading (RULE-007 — Template Reference)

```
1. Check if `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md` exists
2. IF template exists:
   - Read the template
   - Use its 13 sections as the required output structure
   - Log: "Using architecture plan template v1.0.0"
3. IF template does NOT exist (RULE-012 fallback):
   - Log WARNING: "Template not found, using inline format"
   - Fall back to the inline Output Structure defined below
   - Execution continues normally — no interruption
```

**Template Fallback:** When the template file is missing, the skill degrades gracefully to the inline Output Structure. No interruption occurs. A WARNING is logged.

### Step 3 — Read Story/Feature Requirements

Read the story file or feature description provided as argument. Extract: scope, acceptance criteria, integrations, NFRs, constraints.

### Step 4 — Evaluate Decision Tree

Determine if this requires a Full Plan, Simplified Plan, or Skip:
- If Skip: report "Architecture plan not needed for this change" and stop
- If Full or Simplified: proceed to knowledge pack reading

### Step 5 — Read Knowledge Packs

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-plan-architecture Phase-1-KP-Read`

Read knowledge packs **in order** before generating the architecture plan. For Simplified Plan, read only Architecture KP + KPs relevant to affected sections.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-plan-architecture Phase-1-KP-Read ok`

### Step 6 — Review Existing Architecture

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-plan-architecture Phase-2-Component-Diagram`

- Check for existing architecture documents in `steering/`
- Review current codebase structure to understand the baseline
- Identify what is new vs. what is changing

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-plan-architecture Phase-2-Component-Diagram ok`

### Step 7 — Generate Architecture Plan

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-plan-architecture Phase-3-Sequence-Diagrams`

Launch a **single** `general-purpose` subagent with explicit `model: "opus"` (Rule 23 RULE-002 — deep architectural reasoning justifies Opus). Generate ALL mandatory sections.

    Agent(
      subagent_type: "general-purpose",
      model: "opus",
      description: "Architect generates mandatory sections for architecture plan",
      prompt: "Generate all mandatory sections of the architecture plan per the template loaded above"
    )

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-plan-architecture Phase-3-Sequence-Diagrams ok`

### Step 8 — Validate Sections Post-Generation

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-plan-architecture Phase-4-ADR-Mini`

```
1. Parse the generated document for H2 headings (## Section Name)
2. Count sections found vs. sections expected
3. For each conditional section:
   - IF capability is enabled AND section is missing -> WARNING
   - IF capability is disabled AND section is absent -> OK (conditional skip)
4. For each mandatory section:
   - IF section is missing -> WARNING with instruction to complete
5. Log checklist:
   - All present: "Architecture plan: 13/13 sections present"
   - Some missing: "Architecture plan: X/Y applicable sections present, Z conditional skipped"
```

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-plan-architecture Phase-4-ADR-Mini ok`

## Mandatory Sections (13)

| # | Section | Mandatory | Conditional |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Header | Yes | -- |

## Output Structure

| # | Section | Type | Format | Description |
|---|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `# Architecture Plan — {title}` | M | Markdown H1 | Title with story ID or feature name |
| 2 | `## Executive Summary` | M | Paragraph | One-paragraph overview of the architecture |

**Minimum mandatory sections:** 12 (all M sections).

### Output Path

```
ai/epics/epic-XXXX/plans/arch-story-XXXX-YYYY.md
```

Where `XXXX` is the epic ID and `YYYY` is the story sequence number extracted from the story ID.

### Origin Marker (EPIC-0059 — mandatory)

Every generated architecture plan MUST start with a YAML frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
generated-by: x-plan-architecture@<40-char-git-sha>
generated-at: <ISO-8601-UTC>
story-id: <story-id>
---
```

Capture the SHA and timestamp at write time:
- SHA: `git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- Timestamp: `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`

This frontmatter is required by `audit-execution-integrity.sh` Phase-1 validation (EPIC-0059, Rule 24).
Artifacts without this block fail the CI audit with `EIE_EVIDENCE_MISSING`.

## Mini-ADR Format

Each architectural decision is documented inline using this simplified format:

```markdown
### ADR-NNN: {Decision Title}

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

**Context:**
{What is the issue or force motivating this decision? 2-3 sentences.}

**Decision:**
{What is the change being proposed or adopted? 1-2 sentences.}

**Rationale:**
{Why was this option chosen over alternatives? List key trade-offs.}

**Consequences:**
- Positive: {benefits}
- Negative: {trade-offs or risks}

**Story Reference:** {STORY-ID}
```

**Rules:**
- Number ADRs sequentially within the document (ADR-001, ADR-002, ...)
- Each ADR must have a Story Reference linking back to the originating story
- Status must be one of: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- Context and Decision are mandatory; Consequences may be brief for simple decisions

## Subagent Prompt

Launch a **single** `general-purpose` subagent with explicit `model: "opus"` (Rule 23 RULE-002 — deep architectural reasoning justifies Opus):

    Agent(
      subagent_type: "general-purpose",
      model: "opus",
      description: "Senior Architect generates architecture plan for project",
      prompt: "<see the blockquote below>"
    )

## Planning Status Propagation (Rule 22 / EPIC-0046)

> V2-gated: only runs when `SchemaVersionResolver.resolve(ai/epics/epic-XXXX/execution-state.json) == V2`. v1 epics: skip silently (Rule 19).

After writing `arch-story-XXXX-YYYY.md`, this skill checks the associated story's lifecycle status. The architecture plan does NOT itself drive the `Pendente → Planejada` transition — that is owned by `x-plan-story` (Rule 22 single-writer invariant). If the story is still `Pendente` when the architecture plan is generated standalone (i.e. `x-plan-architecture` invoked directly without `x-plan-story`), transition it to `Planejada` here (idempotent if already `Planejada`).

**Steps (end of architecture-plan generation, BEFORE the final commit):**

1. Detect v2 via SchemaVersionResolver on the epic's `execution-state.json`. If v1: skip.
2. Read the story's current status via the CLI:
   ```bash
   CURRENT=$(java -cp $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/java/target/classes \
       dev.iadev.adapter.inbound.cli.StatusFieldParserCli \
       read ai/epics/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md)
   ```
3. If `CURRENT == "Pendente"`, write `Planejada`:
   ```bash
   java -cp $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/java/target/classes \
       dev.iadev.adapter.inbound.cli.StatusFieldParserCli \
       write ai/epics/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md Planejada
   ```
   If `CURRENT == "Planejada"`: idempotent no-op.
4. Stage both files and commit via `x-commit-changes`:
   ```bash
   git add ai/epics/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md ai/epics/epic-XXXX/plans/arch-story-XXXX-YYYY.md
   ```
   Then:

       Skill(skill: "x-commit-changes", args: "docs(story-XXXX-YYYY): add architecture plan + update status to Planejada")

**Fail-loud:** non-zero exit from CLI → abort skill (RULE-046-08).
