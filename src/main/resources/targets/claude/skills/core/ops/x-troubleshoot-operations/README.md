# x-troubleshoot-operations

> Diagnoses errors, stacktraces, build failures, and unexpected behavior. Systematic approach: reproduce, locate, understand, fix, verify. Use whenever something fails: compilation errors, test failures, runtime exceptions, coverage gaps, or performance issues.

## What It Does

Provides a systematic approach to diagnose and fix issues across the project. Covers compilation errors, test failures, build failures, runtime exceptions, and performance issues. Always follows the fix-first-test pattern: write a test that reproduces the bug before fixing it, ensuring the bug-reproducing test prevents regressions.

## Usage

```
/x-troubleshoot-operations
/x-troubleshoot-operations "NullPointerException in TransactionService"
/x-troubleshoot-operations testCalculateTotal_negativeAmount
```

## Workflow

1. **Reproduce** -- Get the exact error (stacktrace, build log, test output)
2. **Locate** -- Find where the error originates in the codebase
3. **Understand** -- Determine why it is failing (expected vs actual behavior)
4. **Fix** -- Write a test that reproduces the bug, then fix the code
5. **Verify** -- Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
