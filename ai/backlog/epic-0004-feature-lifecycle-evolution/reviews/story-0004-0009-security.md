STATUS: Approved

PASSED:
- [1] Input validation (2/2) — N/A: No runtime input processing. All changes are Markdown templates and read-only test assertions on static files. No user-supplied data enters any processing pipeline.
- [2] Output encoding (2/2) — N/A: No output rendering to browsers or APIs. Changes are documentation templates consumed by AI agents, not served to end users.
- [3] Authentication checks (2/2) — N/A: No authentication logic added or modified. Changes are purely Markdown content and Vitest assertions.
- [4] Authorization checks (2/2) — N/A: No authorization logic added or modified. No access control boundaries touched.
- [5] Sensitive data masking (2/2) — N/A: No sensitive data (credentials, PII, tokens, secrets) present in any changed file. Template placeholders (e.g., `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`) contain no real values.
- [6] Error handling — no stack traces (2/2) — N/A: No error handling code added. Test file uses standard Vitest assertions; no try/catch blocks or error responses that could leak stack traces.
- [7] Cryptography usage (2/2) — N/A: No cryptographic operations introduced. No encryption, hashing, key management, or TLS configuration changes.
- [8] Dependency vulnerabilities (2/2) — N/A: No new dependencies added. Test file imports only `vitest` (existing dev dependency) and Node.js built-ins (`fs`, `path`). No package.json changes.
- [9] CORS/CSP headers (2/2) — N/A: No HTTP endpoints, middleware, or server configuration modified. All changes are static Markdown templates and offline tests.
- [10] Audit logging (2/2) — N/A: No auditable operations introduced. Documentation phase template instructs agents to generate docs; no runtime audit events needed.

**Notes:**

This changeset is exclusively documentation-phase content:
- 27 Markdown files: identical additions of a "Phase 3 — Documentation" section to the `x-dev-lifecycle` SKILL.md template, with CLI Documentation Generator subsection, plus renumbering of subsequent phases (old 3-7 becomes 4-8).
- 1 test file (`tests/node/content/x-dev-lifecycle-cli-generator-content.test.ts`): 325 lines of read-only content validation using `fs.readFileSync` on hardcoded paths and Vitest string assertions.

No TypeScript source code, runtime logic, API endpoints, authentication flows, data processing, or dependency changes are included. All 10 security checklist items pass as not applicable — there is no attack surface introduced by this changeset.
