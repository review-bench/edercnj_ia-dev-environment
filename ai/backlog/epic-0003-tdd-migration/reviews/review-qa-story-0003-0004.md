SCORE: 24/24
STATUS: Approved

PASSED:
- [1] Test exists for each acceptance criterion (2/2) — N/A: Pure Markdown content change. The existing byte-for-byte golden file tests (tests/node/integration/byte-for-byte.test.ts) automatically validate that the source of truth (resources/core/13-story-decomposition.md) is correctly propagated to all 16 golden files across 8 profiles x 2 directories (.claude/ and .agents/). MD5 verification confirms all 17 files are identical (bfb59e8b62883f3dcdf0ea31f6d27358). No new acceptance criteria require new test code.
- [2] Line coverage >= 95% (2/2) — N/A: Zero TypeScript code changes (verified: git diff main --name-only -- '*.ts' produces empty output). Coverage is unchanged from baseline (99.6% lines per project memory).
- [3] Branch coverage >= 90% (2/2) — N/A: Zero TypeScript code changes. Coverage is unchanged from baseline (97.84% branches per project memory).
- [4] Test naming convention followed (2/2) — N/A: No new tests added. Existing byte-for-byte.test.ts follows the project's describe/it naming convention.
- [5] AAA pattern used (2/2) — N/A: No new test code written. Existing integration tests use Arrange (pipeline run) / Act (file comparison) / Assert (byte-for-byte match) pattern.
- [6] Parametrized tests for data-driven scenarios (2/2) — N/A: No new test code. Existing byte-for-byte.test.ts already uses describe.sequential.each across all 8 profiles, providing parametrized coverage for this content change.
- [7] Exception paths tested (2/2) — N/A: This is a content-only change to a Markdown rule file. There are no code exception paths introduced. The golden file test will fail (providing error feedback) if any golden file does not match the pipeline output.
- [8] No test interdependency (2/2) — N/A: No new tests. Existing byte-for-byte tests are profile-isolated; each profile's golden comparison is independent.
- [9] Fixtures centralized (2/2) — N/A: Golden files serve as the test fixtures for this story. All 16 golden files are identical copies of the single source of truth, centralized at resources/core/13-story-decomposition.md. Verified via MD5 checksums.
- [10] Unique test data (2/2) — N/A: No new test data generators needed. Each profile runs against its own golden directory, ensuring isolation.
- [11] Edge cases covered (2/2) — N/A: The content changes are purely additive (new sub-section SD-02 Gherkin Completeness, SD-05 minimum raised 2->4, new SD-05a Scenario Ordering, 4 new anti-patterns). No existing SD-XX principles were removed or renumbered. The byte-for-byte test inherently covers the edge case of content drift between source and golden files.
- [12] Integration tests for DB/API (2/2) — N/A: No database or API changes. The existing integration test (byte-for-byte.test.ts) validates the full pipeline: source -> fs.copyFileSync -> output, compared against golden files. This is the relevant integration path for content changes.
```

### Review Notes

**Scope verification:** 19 content files changed total — 1 source of truth Markdown, 16 golden file copies (byte-for-byte identical, confirmed via MD5), 2 documentation files (implementation plan + test plan); excludes this review file and other review artifacts. Zero TypeScript, zero JSON, zero configuration changes.

**Content consistency:** All four content additions (SD-02 Gherkin Completeness, SD-05 minimum 2->4, SD-05a Scenario Ordering, Anti-Patterns) are present in the source and replicated identically across all 16 golden files. The diff hunks are structurally identical across all 17 Markdown files.

**Risk assessment:** LOW. No code paths changed, no routing changes, no pipeline logic changes. The existing byte-for-byte test infrastructure provides full regression coverage for this type of content change.
