SCORE: 26/26
STATUS: Approved

PASSED:
- [1] No N+1 queries (2/2) — N/A: No database access or queries. Changes are pure Markdown content files copied via fs.copyFileSync.
- [2] Connection pool sized (2/2) — N/A: No database connections. No TypeScript code changes in this story.
- [3] Async where applicable (2/2) — N/A: No runtime code modified. The pipeline's existing fs.copyFileSync is synchronous by design for byte-for-byte golden file consistency; this story does not alter that path.
- [4] Pagination on collections (2/2) — N/A: No collection endpoints or data retrieval added.
- [5] Caching strategy (2/2) — N/A: No cacheable resources introduced. Markdown files are static content read at generation time.
- [6] No unbounded lists (2/2) — N/A: No lists or collections in runtime code. The Markdown tables added are fixed-size (6 rows in the TPP ordering table, 4 bullet points in Gherkin requirements).
- [7] Timeout on external calls (2/2) — N/A: No external calls added or modified.
- [8] Circuit breaker on external (2/2) — N/A: No external dependencies introduced.
- [9] Thread safety (2/2) — N/A: No concurrent access patterns introduced. File copies are deterministic and sequential.
- [10] Resource cleanup (2/2) — N/A: No file handles, streams, or connections opened. fs.copyFileSync manages its own handles internally.
- [11] Lazy loading (2/2) — N/A: No new modules, imports, or resource loading added.
- [12] Batch operations (2/2) — N/A: No bulk data operations. The 16 golden file copies are handled by the existing pipeline which already iterates over profiles; this story only changes the content, not the iteration pattern.
- [13] Index usage (2/2) — N/A: No database tables or queries affected.

### Analysis Summary

**Scope:** 19 non-review files changed (1 source Markdown + 16 golden file copies + 2 plan/test documents), excluding this review document and related review artifacts. Zero TypeScript code changes. Net addition of ~32 lines to a 244-line Markdown file, duplicated across 16 golden fixtures via the existing `fs.copyFileSync` pipeline.

**Performance impact assessment:**
- **Build time:** Negligible. The 16 golden files are byte-for-byte copies; the ~32 additional lines per file add <1KB each, totaling <16KB across all copies. No measurable impact on `fs.copyFileSync` performance.
- **Test time:** No impact. The byte-for-byte integration test (`byte-for-byte.test.ts`) compares file contents; slightly larger files have no meaningful effect on comparison speed.
- **Runtime:** Zero. These Markdown files are consumed by AI agents at prompt time, not by application runtime code.
- **Memory:** No impact. No new data structures, caches, or buffers introduced.

All 13 checklist items score 2/2 as N/A (not applicable to pure Markdown content changes = no risk = pass).
