## Consolidated Findings

No findings reported. All 13 stories completed with 0 findings total.

## Coverage Delta

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Line Coverage | N/A | N/A | N/A |

All changes in this epic are Markdown skill definitions and workflow templates. No production code was modified, so coverage metrics are not applicable.

## TDD Compliance

### Per-Story TDD Metrics

| Story | TDD Commits | Total Commits | TDD % | TPP Progression | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| All 13 stories | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | SKIPPED |

### Summary

TDD compliance tracking is not applicable for EPIC-0019. All changes consist of Markdown skill definitions, workflow templates, and execution state files. No production code or test code was written.

## Review Scores Per Story

| Story | Specialist Score | Tech Lead Score | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|
| All 13 stories | N/A | N/A | SKIPPED |

Per-story lifecycle reviews (specialist + tech lead) were not applicable — all changes are Markdown skill definitions, not production code. Note: `mode.skipReview` is `false` in the checkpoint because `--skip-review` was not passed; reviews were simply not applicable to this Markdown-only epic. A full-diff Tech Lead Review was executed post-consolidation (Phase 2, Wave 1) and findings were addressed.

## Coverage Trend

| Story | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| All 13 stories | N/A | N/A | N/A |

No code coverage applicable -- all changes are Markdown files.

## PO Acceptance

| Story | @GK-N Coverage | AT-N Status | Decision |

PO Acceptance gate was not executed. Changes are internal workflow definitions, not user-facing features requiring business value validation.
