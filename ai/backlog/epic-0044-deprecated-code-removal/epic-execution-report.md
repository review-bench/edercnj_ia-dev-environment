## 2. Story Results & PR Links

| Story | PR | Status | Tech Lead Score | Merged At | Commit on develop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [story-0044-0001](./story-0044-0001.md) | [#407](https://github.com/edercnj/ia-dev-environment/pull/407) | **MERGED** | — (skipped) | 2026-04-16T20:15:56Z | `0097ed975` |
| [story-0044-0002](./story-0044-0002.md) | [#409](https://github.com/edercnj/ia-dev-environment/pull/409) | **MERGED** | — (skipped) | 2026-04-16T20:18:22Z | `e3c450a51` |

## 3. Phase Timeline

| Phase | Start SHA | End SHA | Duration (wall-clock) | Stories |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | `176847c9d` | `e3c450a51` | ~80 min (dispatched 19:04 → merge 20:18 + gate) | story-0044-0001, story-0044-0002 |

**Parallelism effective:** Phase 0 dispatched both stories in parallel via explicit `git worktree`. story-0044-0002 (~27 min) dominated the critical path; story-0044-0001 (~20 min) finished first.

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Production Symbols Removed (6 total)

| # | Symbol | File | Substitute |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `StackMapping.DATABASE_SETTINGS_MAP` | `domain/stack/StackMapping.java` | `DatabaseSettingsMapping.DATABASE_SETTINGS_MAP` |
| 2 | `StackMapping.CACHE_SETTINGS_MAP` | `domain/stack/StackMapping.java` | `DatabaseSettingsMapping.CACHE_SETTINGS_MAP` |
| 3 | `StackMapping.getDatabaseSettingsKey(String)` | `domain/stack/StackMapping.java` | `DatabaseSettingsMapping.getDatabaseSettingsKey(String)` |
| 4 | `StackMapping.getCacheSettingsKey(String)` | `domain/stack/StackMapping.java` | `DatabaseSettingsMapping.getCacheSettingsKey(String)` |
| 5 | `ResourceResolver.resolveResourcesRoot(String)` | `util/ResourceResolver.java` | `ResourceResolver.resolveResourceDir(String)` |
| 6 | `ResourceResolver.resolveResourcesRoot(String, int)` | `util/ResourceResolver.java` | `ResourceResolver.resolveResourceDir(String)` (depth eliminated; caller pattern `resolveResourceDir("shared").getParent()` when root needed) |

### 4.2 Callers Migrated (24 production files + 29+ test files)

- **story-0044-0001:** `PermissionCollector.java` (2 calls at lines 122, 128) + 5 test files migrated/cleaned.
- **story-0044-0002:** 23 assemblers across 4 waves + `AssemblerFactory` + 9 test helpers (inc. `ResourceResolverTest`, 18 `*AssemblerTest.java`, `TimeseriesKnowledgeTest`).

### 4.3 New Tests

- `domain/stack/StackMappingDeprecatedRemovedTest.java` — 4 reflection assertions (`NoSuchFieldException` / `NoSuchMethodException`).
- `util/ResourceResolverDeprecatedRemovedTest.java` — 2 reflection assertions.

### 4.4 CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` updated under `## [Unreleased]` → `### Removed` with both stories' entries (6 symbols total, 2 nested bullets).

## 5. Integrity Gate Results (post-merge, on `develop`)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `mvn clean compile` | **PASS** · 0 `[removal]` warnings |
| `mvn test-compile` | **PASS** · 0 `[removal]` warnings |
| `mvn clean verify` | **PASS** · 859 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped |
| Jacoco coverage check | **PASS** · all thresholds met (≥95% line, ≥90% branch per RULE-003) |
| Smoke tests (failsafe integration) | **PASS** · included in `mvn verify` (`ProfilePlatformIntegritySmokeTest`, `PlatformPipelineIntegrationTest`, `AutoVersionDetectionSmokeTest`, golden file tests, etc.) |
| `grep` residual symbol refs | **PASS** · 2 test files contain references (`StackMappingDeprecatedRemovedTest.java`, `ResourceResolverDeprecatedRemovedTest.java` — expected, as they assert absence via reflection); **0 production references** |
| Cross-story consistency | **PASS** · diff `176847c9d..e3c450a51` reviewed; no inconsistency between the two stories' patterns |

## 6. Version Bump

**NONE** (per RULE-005 / Rule 08). All commits use `refactor:` prefix → Conventional Commits signals no version bump. Current version unchanged.

## 7. TDD Compliance

| Story | TDD Cycles | Coverage Line | Coverage Branch | Pattern |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| story-0044-0001 | 3 | 95.21% | 90.40% | RED via reflection test → GREEN via callers migration → REFACTOR via symbol removal |
| story-0044-0002 | 6 | 95.21% | 90.25% | 4 waves of migration + test cleanup + removal; each wave verified by `mvn compile`/`mvn test` scoped run |

## 8. Deviations from Plan

> All deviations below are **documented and not blocking**. The user was informed and approved continuation via "C" (default auto-merge).

### 8.1 Specialist + Tech Lead Reviews Skipped

Both subagents (for story-0044-0001 and story-0044-0002) recorded `reviewsExecuted.specialist = false` and `reviewsExecuted.techLead = false`. Justification cited by both: `merge_mode=auto` signalled an unattended flow, and the refactor is deterministic and fully verified by `mvn verify` + reflection tests + coverage gate.

**Impact:** LOW. The integrity gate on `develop` post-merge substituted for the missing story-level reviews. The refactor has zero behavioral change surface (public API of `DatabaseSettingsMapping` / `resolveResourceDir` was preserved; 6 internal deprecated symbols removed).

**Recommendation:** For future EPIC-0042 default flows, consider making specialist review mandatory unless `--skip-review` is explicit. The subagents' interpretation of `merge_mode=auto` as "skip reviews" is a template gap, not a user directive.

### 8.2 Migration Pattern Discovery (story-0044-0002)

The story §5.3 recipe (`resolveResourcesRoot(TEMPLATE_PATH, DEPTH)` → `resolveResourceDir(TEMPLATE_PATH)`) is semantically **incorrect** when the caller's probe is a file path (not a directory). `resolveResourceDir` throws `IllegalArgumentException` at runtime for file-valued markers (e.g., `DocsAssembler`'s `TEMPLATE_PATH = "shared/templates/_TEMPLATE-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md"`).

The subagent adopted a uniform minimum-disruption pattern across all 23 assemblers + 9 test helpers: `resolveResourceDir("shared").getParent()`. This preserves the pre-existing `resourcesDir = resources-root` semantics. Golden files remained byte-identical (no regeneration needed). Documented in each task commit body and the PR #409 description.

**Impact:** LOW (functionally equivalent, zero golden drift), but **story §5.3 recipe should be corrected** in future story authoring.

### 8.3 Rebase Conflict Resolution

PR #409 was force-pushed after rebasing onto the updated `develop` (which contained PR #407). Conflicts resolved manually by the orchestrator:
- `CHANGELOG.md` → combined both `### Removed` blocks into one.
- `plans/epic-0044/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` → both Status columns set to `Concluida`.

No lost commits; rebase preserved all 7 branch commits (6 atomic task + 1 meta docs).

### 8.4 execution-state.json Asymmetry

Both subagents committed `plans/epic-0044/execution-state.json` in their branches (as status update artefact). After merge, `develop` ended up with story-0044-0001's view (which only tracks story-0001's tasks). The orchestrator's complete state (with final `MERGED` / `SUCCESS` values, merge commit SHAs, integrity gate outcome, and version bump decision) is preserved in `plans/epic-0044/reports/epic-orchestrator-state.json` (committed by this docs PR — the file has a top-level `capturedAt` field documenting that the values reflect the terminal lifecycle state). This is a minor housekeeping gap; not a blocker.

## 9. Unresolved Issues

None. All 6 deprecated symbols successfully removed, both PRs merged, integrity gate green, CHANGELOG updated.

## 10. DoD Checklist Validation (epic-0044 §3)

- [x] **Coverage:** ≥ 95% Line (95.21%), ≥ 90% Branch (90.25%). Preserved above baseline.
- [x] **Testes automatizados:** `mvn verify` green. Suites `StackMappingTest`, `ResourceResolverTest`, 18 `*AssemblerTest.java` green. 2 new reflection tests added.
- [x] **Smoke Tests:** Maven build completed with zero `[removal]` warnings referencing the 6 removed symbols.
- [x] **Relatório de cobertura:** Jacoco XML generated at `java/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`.
