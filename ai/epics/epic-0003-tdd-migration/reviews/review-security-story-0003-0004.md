STATUS: Approved

PASSED:
- [1] Input validation (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. All modifications are Markdown content files (documentation/rules). No user input is processed, parsed, or stored. No attack surface introduced.
- [2] Output encoding (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No HTTP responses, HTML rendering, or dynamic output generation affected. Markdown content is consumed as static text by the pipeline via fs.copyFileSync with zero transformation.
- [3] Authentication checks (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No authentication flows, middleware, or token handling modified. Changes are limited to rule definition content and test fixture copies.
- [4] Authorization checks (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No authorization logic, role checks, or access control paths affected.
- [5] Sensitive data masking (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. The Markdown content contains only process guidelines (Gherkin scenario ordering, minimum thresholds, anti-patterns). No PII, credentials, secrets, tokens, or classified data present in any of the 19 non-review content files changed in this PR.
- [6] Error handling / no stack traces (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No error handling paths, catch blocks, or response formatting modified. The pipeline code (rules-assembler.ts, core-kp-routing.ts) is explicitly unchanged per the plan and confirmed by the diff.
- [7] Cryptography usage (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No cryptographic operations, key material, hashing, TLS configuration, or cipher suite selection introduced or modified.
- [8] Dependency vulnerabilities (2/2) — N/A: No dependency changes. No package.json, package-lock.json, or any dependency manifest modified. The diff contains zero changes to build files or imports.
- [9] CORS/CSP headers (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No HTTP server configuration, middleware, header definitions, or response interceptors affected.
- [10] Audit logging (2/2) — N/A: No code changes. No logging statements added, removed, or modified. No audit trail requirements impacted by documentation-only changes.

## Analysis Summary

There are 19 non-review content files in this diff, all of which are Markdown (`.md`) files:
- 1 source-of-truth rule file (`resources/core/13-story-decomposition.md`)
- 16 golden test fixture copies (8 profiles x 2 directories: `.claude/` and `.agents/`)
- 2 documentation files (`plan-story-0003-0004.md`, `tests-story-0003-0004.md`)

In addition, this PR adds 4 Markdown review artifacts (security, QA, performance, tech lead), for a total of 23 changed files, all Markdown.

**Zero TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, YAML, or configuration files are modified.** The diff introduces no executable code, no dependency changes, no infrastructure changes, and no API surface modifications. The content changes are purely additive process guidelines (Gherkin completeness requirements, scenario ordering, minimum thresholds, and anti-patterns).

The golden file copies are byte-for-byte identical to the source-of-truth file, consistent with the `fs.copyFileSync` pipeline behavior documented in the plan. No transformation or injection vector exists.

**Verdict:** All 10 security checklist items score 2/2 (N/A = no risk = pass). No security concerns identified.
