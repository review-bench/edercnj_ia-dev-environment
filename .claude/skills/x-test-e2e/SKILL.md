# Skill: End-to-End Tests

## Purpose

Run or implement end-to-end tests that validate the complete application flow: inbound request -> parsing -> validation -> business logic -> persistence -> response. Tests use a real database (or in-memory equivalent) and exercise all layers of the architecture.

## Activation Condition

Include this skill for all projects with integration test infrastructure.

## Triggers

- `/x-test-e2e` -- run all E2E tests
- `/x-test-e2e happy-path` -- run only happy path scenarios
- `/x-test-e2e persistent` -- run persistent connection tests
- `/x-test-e2e all` -- run all scenarios explicitly

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `scenario` | String | No | `all` | Scenario filter: `happy-path`, `error`, `timeout`, `persistent`, `all` |

## Knowledge Pack References

| Pack | Files | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| testing | `skills/testing/references/testing-philosophy.md` | Real vs in-memory DB decisions, fixture patterns, data uniqueness |
| testing | `skills/testing/references/testing-conventions.md` | {{LANGUAGE}}-specific test framework, assertion library, directory structure |

## Prerequisites

- {{FRAMEWORK}} test extension configured
- Database available for tests (in-memory or containerized via {{DB_TYPE}})
- Test dependencies in {{BUILD_FILE}}: assertion library, async utilities
- E2E test classes exist in the test source tree

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Verify Test Infrastructure

Check that required dependencies exist:
- Framework test extension (e.g., `@QuarkusTest`, `@SpringBootTest`)
- Database for tests configured in test profile
- Assertion library available

### Step 2 — Run E2E Tests

Execute with:
```
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
```
- Filter by scenario tag if a specific scenario was requested
- Ensure test profile is active (in-memory DB, random ports, etc.)

### Step 3 — Validate Test Results

- All tests pass (exit code 0)
- No test pollution (each test is independent)
- Database state verified after operations

### Step 4 — Report Results

- Total: passed / failed / skipped
- Duration per test class
- Failed tests with error details and stack traces
- Coverage report location (if generated)

## Mandatory E2E Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Happy path | Standard request processed successfully, persisted | CRITICAL |
| Validation error | Invalid input rejected with proper error response | CRITICAL |
| Not found | Request for non-existent resource returns proper error | HIGH |
| Duplicate/conflict | Duplicate creation attempt returns conflict response | HIGH |
| Persistent connection | Multiple requests on same connection (if applicable) | HIGH |
| Concurrent requests | Multiple simultaneous requests processed independently | HIGH |
| Malformed input | Garbage input handled gracefully without crash | MEDIUM |
| Timeout behavior | Slow operations handled per configured timeouts | MEDIUM |
| Error recovery | Server continues operating after encountering errors | MEDIUM |

## Test Patterns

### Test Isolation
- Each test creates its own data, never depends on other tests
- Use unique identifiers per test execution to avoid conflicts
- Automatic cleanup via transaction rollback or explicit teardown

### Async Resource Readiness
- Wait for server/socket to be listening before connecting
- Use async polling (not `Thread.sleep`) for resource readiness
- Default timeout: 10 seconds for resource startup

### Assertion Style
- Use fluent assertion library (AssertJ, Chai, etc.)
- Verify both response content AND database state
- Check response status codes, headers, and body

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Test infrastructure missing | Report missing dependencies with install instructions |
| Database unavailable | Report connection failure and suggest starting database container |
| Test pollution detected | Warn about shared state and suggest test isolation improvements |
| Build fails before tests | Report compilation errors and abort test execution |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Tests exercise the complete flow (input -> all layers -> output)
- [ ] Real or realistic database used (not mocked)
- [ ] Each test is independent and idempotent
- [ ] Unique identifiers generated per test run
- [ ] Async resources awaited with polling (not sleep)
- [ ] Both response and database state verified
- [ ] Error scenarios covered (validation, not-found, conflict)
- [ ] Connection persistence tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Concurrent request handling validated
- [ ] No test pollution between test classes
