## What It Does

Performs a senior-level holistic code review using a 45-point rubric across 11 dimensions including code hygiene, naming, functions, formatting, design, error handling, architecture, framework usage, tests, security, and TDD process. Reviews the full PR diff for cross-file consistency, produces a scored GO/NO-GO decision, and updates the consolidated review dashboard and remediation tracking if previous specialist reviews exist.

## Usage

```
/x-review-pr
/x-review-pr 42

```

## Workflow

1. **Idempotency** -- Skip if report exists and code is unchanged since last review
2. **Detect** -- Identify branch, diff, and story context from argument or current branch
3. **Gather** -- Read knowledge packs and check for existing specialist review artifacts
4. **Template** -- Detect Tech Lead review template for output format
5. **Review** -- Execute 45-point checklist against full diff and source files
6. **Dashboard** -- Update consolidated dashboard with Tech Lead score
7. **Remediation** -- Update remediation tracking with FIXED/new findings
