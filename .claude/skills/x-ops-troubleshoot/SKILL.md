# Skill: Troubleshoot

## Purpose

Provides a systematic approach to diagnose and fix issues in {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Covers compilation errors, test failures, build failures, runtime exceptions, and domain-specific bugs.

## Triggers

- `/x-ops-troubleshoot` — diagnose issues using the full debug workflow
- `/x-ops-troubleshoot "NullPointerException in PaymentService"` — diagnose a specific error
- `/x-ops-troubleshoot testMethodName` — diagnose a specific test failure

## Workflow

```
1. REPRODUCE  -> Get the exact error (stacktrace, build log, test output)
2. LOCATE     -> Find where the error originates
3. UNDERSTAND -> Why is it failing? Expected vs actual behavior?
4. FIX        -> Write a test that reproduces the bug, then fix the code
5. VERIFY     -> Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
```

Always follow this order. Never skip step 4's "write a test first" — the bug-reproducing test prevents regressions.

### Step 1 — Reproduce

Get the exact error output. Run the relevant command and capture the full stacktrace, build log, or test output.

```bash
{{COMPILE_COMMAND}}
```

### Step 2 — Locate

Find where the error originates using the error patterns below.

#### 2.1 — Compilation Errors

The error patterns below are {{LANGUAGE}}-specific. Adapt to the actual compiler/interpreter messages for the project:

| Error Category | Likely Cause | Fix |
|----------------|--------------|-----|
| Missing symbol/type | Missing import, typo in class name | Check package structure, verify imports |
| Type mismatch | Wrong type in assignment/return | Check type inference, explicit cast if needed |
| Sealed type error | Missing permits/implementations | Add implementing class to sealed hierarchy |
| Missing package/module | Wrong package or missing dependency | Verify directory matches package, check deps |
| Interface mismatch | Signature mismatch with interface | Compare method signature with interface def |

#### 2.2 — Test Failures

```bash
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
```

| Failure Type | Diagnosis | Fix |
|--------------|-----------|-----|
| Assertion error (expected X got Y) | Logic bug in production code | Compare expected vs actual, trace the logic |
| NullPointerException in test | Missing setup | Initialize all objects test needs |
| Test passes alone, fails in suite | Shared mutable state | Ensure fresh objects per test |
| Timeout in test | Async issue or infinite loop | Check for blocking calls, add timeouts |

#### 2.3 — Build Failures

```bash
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}
```

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Coverage threshold failure | Coverage below threshold | Write more tests, check coverage report |
| Dependency resolution failure | Missing or conflicting dep | Check build file, resolve conflicts |
| Out of memory | Memory issue in test/build | Increase memory limits, check for leaks |

#### 2.4 — Runtime Errors

The error patterns below are {{LANGUAGE}}-specific. Adapt to the actual runtime error messages for the project:

| Error Category | Likely Cause | Fix |
|----------------|--------------|-----|
| Missing class/module at runtime | Missing dependency at runtime | Check classpath/module path, add dependency |
| Method/function not found | Version mismatch | Align dependency versions |
| Connection refused | Service not running | Start required services, check ports |
| Circuit breaker open | Downstream service failure | Check downstream health, wait for recovery |

#### 2.5 — Performance Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Slow response | N+1 queries, missing indexes | Add indexes, optimize queries |
| Memory growing | Object leak, missing cleanup | Profile memory, fix resource management |
| Thread starvation | Blocking on event loop | Use async patterns, offload to workers |

### Step 3 — Understand

Analyze why the error occurs. Compare expected vs actual behavior. Trace the data flow from input to the failure point.

### Step 4 — Fix (Test-First)

For every bug found:

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (it MUST FAIL)
2. Fix the code
3. Verify the test PASSES
4. Run full test suite for regressions

```
// This test was added for bug #NNN
// Previously [describe the bug]
```

### Step 5 — Verify

Run the full test suite. Confirm zero regressions. Check coverage thresholds.

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

When something fails, check in this order:

1. **Compilation error?** — Read the error message carefully
2. **Test failure?** — Read expected vs actual, run test in isolation
3. **Coverage failure?** — Check coverage report, find uncovered branches
4. **Dependency issue?** — Check build file, verify versions
5. **Configuration issue?** — Check properties, environment variables
6. **Intermittent?** — Suspect shared mutable state, race conditions

## Error Classification for Group Verifier

When troubleshooting within the feature lifecycle, classify errors for `x-lib-group-verifier`:

| Classification | When | Action |
|----------------|------|--------|
| TASK_ERROR | Error in current group's code | Retry same tier |
| MISSING_DEPENDENCY | Missing type from previous group | Halt, flag regression |
| BUILD_ERROR | Missing external dependency | Halt, fix build file |
| UNKNOWN | Unrecognized error pattern | Escalate tier |

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Stacktrace not available | Request the user to provide the full error output |
| Error in third-party library | Verify dependency versions, check for known issues upstream |
| Non-reproducible failure | Investigate shared mutable state, race conditions, or environment differences |
| Fix introduces new failures | Revert the fix, re-analyze root cause with broader context |

## Integration Notes

| Skill | Relationship | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| x-lib-group-verifier | Referenced by | Invokes troubleshoot when compilation fails during group verification |
| x-story-implement | Referenced by | Used during Phase 4 (fixes) for diagnosing test and build failures |
| x-test-run | Complements | Troubleshoot diagnoses failures that x-test-run reports |
