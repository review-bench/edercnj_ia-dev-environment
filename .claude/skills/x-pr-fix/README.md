## What It Does

Automates the process of addressing PR review comments by fetching all review comments from a pull request, classifying them by type (actionable, suggestion, question, praise, resolved), and implementing fixes for actionable feedback. After each fix, it verifies compilation and tests, replies to comment threads with a summary of the action taken, and commits changes with conventional commit messages.

## Usage

```
/x-pr-fix
/x-pr-fix 123
```

## Workflow

1. **Detect** -- Identify PR from argument or current branch
2. **Fetch** -- Get all review comments via GitHub CLI
3. **Classify** -- Categorize each comment (actionable/suggestion/question/praise/resolved)
4. **Fix** -- Implement fixes for actionable comments, file-by-file top-to-bottom
5. **Verify** -- Compile and test after each fix; revert if broken
6. **Reply** -- Reply to each comment thread with fix summary or rejection reason
7. **Commit** -- Commit with conventional commit message referencing the PR
