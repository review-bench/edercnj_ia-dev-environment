# Skill: x-internal-story-resume

## Purpose

Carve out the story-resume detection logic currently duplicated across
`x-story-implement` Phase 0 (step 8, "Resume detection") into a single,
single-responsibility skill. The ~120 inline lines the orchestrator
previously used to classify in-flight task state become a single
`Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume", …)` invocation; the orchestrator
shrinks to a read-the-envelope consumer that drives its branch-creation
and task-dispatch decisions off the four response fields.

Responsibilities (single):

1. Resolve and read `plans/epic-XXXX/execution-state.json` via
   `x-internal-status-update --read-only` so the concurrency contract
   (shared `flock -s`) is honoured identically to every other
   read consumer (`x-internal-story-load-context`,
   `x-status-reconcile` diagnose mode).
2. Locate the `stories.<id>` node and its `tasks.*` sub-nodes; when the
   story is absent from the state file, exit `2`
   (`STORY_NOT_IN_STATE`).
3. Classify each task by its `status` field:
   - `DONE` / `MERGED` / `COMPLETE` → append to `tasksCompleted` with
     its `commitSha` (null when absent from the state node).
   - `PENDING` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `FAILED` / `BLOCKED` → append to
     `tasksPending`.
4. Determine the resume point:
   - `fresh-start` when `tasksCompleted` is empty (no DONE task
     observed).
   - `all-done` when `tasksPending` is empty AND at least one task
     is DONE.
   - `phase-2-task-<N>` otherwise, where `<N>` is the 1-based index
     of the first PENDING / IN_PROGRESS task in the task-order of
     the state file (not the task-ID numeric suffix).
5. Extract `lastCommitSha` as the `commitSha` of the most recently
   completed task (the last DONE task in task-order); `null` when
   `tasksCompleted` is empty.
6. Compute `staleWarnings`: when `mtime(story file) >` any DONE task's
   `completedAt` timestamp (ISO-8601 in state file), append
   `Story file modified after task <TASK-ID> DONE` — one warning per
   DONE task whose `completedAt` is older than the story mtime. An
   empty array is emitted when no warning applies or when the
   story-file mtime is unavailable.

Non-responsibilities (explicit):

- The skill does NOT mutate the state file, the story markdown, or
  any commit metadata. It does NOT invoke `git` beyond what its
  upstream `x-internal-status-update --read-only` may do internally.
- The skill does NOT create branches, run PR operations, or dispatch
  tasks — the caller (`x-story-implement` Phase 0 → Phase 2 wiring)
  owns those transitions.
- The skill does NOT resolve unknown task statuses to a default — any
  status not in the recognised success/pending synonym sets is
  treated as PENDING with a stderr warning; the envelope stays
  well-formed.

## Convention Anchors (x-internal-*)

| Aspect | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Path | `internal/plan/x-internal-story-resume/` | `internal/` prefix scopes visibility; `plan/` co-locates with the other carve-outs of the story-level planning/verification pipeline (`x-internal-story-load-context`, `x-internal-story-build-plan`, `x-internal-story-verify`) |
| Frontmatter `visibility` | `internal` | Generator filters these from `/help` menu |
| Frontmatter `user-invocable` | `false` | Declarative complement to `visibility: internal` |
| Body marker | `> 🔒 **INTERNAL SKILL**` block as first non-frontmatter content | Visible to humans browsing the repo; no parsing required |
| Allowed tools | `Bash` only | The skill shells out to `jq` for state-file parsing, `stat` for mtime comparisons, and `date` for timestamp → epoch coercion; no `Skill` / `Agent` needed — resume detection is a leaf read-only operation |
| Naming | `x-internal-{subject}-{action}` | Mirrors Rule 04 skill taxonomy; `story-resume` = subject+action |

Audit rule: Rule 22 (Lifecycle Integrity) validates every skill under
`internal/**` satisfies all 6 anchors above. Violations fail
`LifecycleIntegrityAuditTest`.

## Triggers

Bare-slash form is intentionally omitted — this skill is never invoked
by a human typing `/x-internal-story-resume` in chat. All invocations
follow Rule 13 INLINE-SKILL pattern from a calling orchestrator:

```markdown
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--story-id <id>` | M | — | Story identifier (`story-XXXX-YYYY` canonical form) |
| `--epic-id <id>` | M | — | 4-digit epic identifier (`XXXX`) — used to resolve `plans/epic-XXXX/` |

All three argument forms (`--key value`, `--key=value`, and unknown-flag
rejection) are supported; unknown flags and missing required flags exit
with `64` (sysexits `EX_USAGE`). The `--story-id` value is normalised
to lowercase and validated against `^story-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}$`;
`--epic-id` is zero-padded to 4 digits.

## Response Contract

When successful (exit code 0), the skill writes a single-line JSON
object to stdout. The envelope is always well-formed JSON; consumers
MUST read `resumePoint` as the authoritative branching signal.

| Field | Type | Always Present | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `resumePoint` | `String` | yes | One of: `fresh-start` (nothing DONE), `all-done` (every task DONE), or `phase-2-task-<N>` where `<N>` is the 1-based index of the first PENDING/IN_PROGRESS task |
| `tasksCompleted` | `Array<{id:String, commitSha:String\|Null}>` | yes | One entry per DONE task in task-order; `commitSha` is `null` when absent from the state node |
| `tasksPending` | `Array<String>` | yes | Task IDs (e.g., `TASK-0049-0013-002`) of PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/FAILED/BLOCKED tasks, in task-order |
| `lastCommitSha` | `String\|Null` | yes | `commitSha` of the most recent DONE task; `null` when `tasksCompleted` is empty |
| `staleWarnings` | `Array<String>` | yes | Human-readable warnings when the story file's mtime is newer than a DONE task's `completedAt`; empty when no warning applies |

### Example envelope (happy path — 3 DONE of 5)

```json
{"resumePoint":"phase-2-task-4","tasksCompleted":[{"id":"TASK-0049-0013-001","commitSha":"abc123"},{"id":"TASK-0049-0013-002","commitSha":"def456"},{"id":"TASK-0049-0013-003","commitSha":"ghi789"}],"tasksPending":["TASK-0049-0013-004","TASK-0049-0013-005"],"lastCommitSha":"ghi789","staleWarnings":[]}
```

### Example envelope (fresh start)

```json
{"resumePoint":"fresh-start","tasksCompleted":[],"tasksPending":["TASK-0049-0013-001","TASK-0049-0013-002","TASK-0049-0013-003","TASK-0049-0013-004"],"lastCommitSha":null,"staleWarnings":[]}
```

### Example envelope (all done with stale warning)

```json
{"resumePoint":"all-done","tasksCompleted":[{"id":"TASK-0049-0013-001","commitSha":"abc123"},{"id":"TASK-0049-0013-002","commitSha":"def456"}],"tasksPending":[],"lastCommitSha":"def456","staleWarnings":["Story file modified after task TASK-0049-0013-001 DONE","Story file modified after task TASK-0049-0013-002 DONE"]}
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Name | Condition | Message Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | SUCCESS | Envelope emitted | — |
| 1 | STATE_FILE_MISSING | `plans/epic-XXXX/execution-state.json` absent | `execution-state.json not found` |
| 2 | STORY_NOT_IN_STATE | Story not registered inside the state file's `stories` map | `Story not in execution-state.json` |
| 64 | EX_USAGE | Unknown or malformed flag | `usage: --story-id <id> --epic-id <id>` |
| 127 | DEPENDENCY_MISSING | `jq` absent on `PATH` | `dependency missing: jq` |

No JSON is written to stdout on any non-zero exit — callers distinguish
success from failure by exit code, not by parsing stdout.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Argument parsing and path resolution

Parse `--story-id` and `--epic-id`; reject unknown flags and missing
required flags with exit `64`. Derive canonical paths:

```bash
epic_dir="plans/epic-${epic_id}"
story_file="${epic_dir}/${story_id}.md"
state_file="${epic_dir}/execution-state.json"
```

When `${state_file}` is not a regular file, exit `1`
(`STATE_FILE_MISSING`). The skill does NOT require `story_file` to
exist — it is only consulted for its mtime in Step 4; when absent,
`staleWarnings` is emitted empty with no error.

### Step 2 — Read state envelope via read-only delegate

Invoke the pilot skill in read-only mode to leverage its
`flock -s`-based shared lock and schema validation:

```bash
envelope=$(Skill(skill: "x-internal-status-update",
                 args: "--file ${state_file} --type story \
                        --id ${story_id} --read-only"))
```

The returned envelope contains the current `stories.<id>` node
verbatim. When the response envelope's `previousValue` is `null`
(the id is absent from the schema), exit `2`
(`STORY_NOT_IN_STATE`).

Fallback (degraded mode): if `x-internal-status-update` is unavailable
(e.g., during bootstrap when the pilot skill itself is being
generated), fall back to a direct `jq` read:

```bash
story_node=$(jq -c ".stories[\"${story_id}\"] // empty" \
             "${state_file}")
```

An empty `story_node` triggers exit `2`.

### Step 3 — Classify tasks

Iterate over `story_node.tasks` preserving insertion order (jq's
`keys_unsorted`). For each task `<id>` with node `<t>`:

```bash
status=$(echo "${t}" | jq -r '.status // "PENDING"')
sha=$(echo "${t}"    | jq -r '.commitSha // null')
completedAt=$(echo "${t}" | jq -r '.completedAt // null')
```

Classify:

| `status` (case-insensitive) | Bucket |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DONE`, `MERGED`, `COMPLETE`, `Concluída`, `Concluida` | `tasksCompleted` (append `{id, commitSha: sha}`) |
| `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PR_CREATED`, `PR_APPROVED`, `PR_MERGED`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`, `UNKNOWN`, any other value | `tasksPending` (append `id`) |

`PR_MERGED` — note: treated as pending when `commitSha` is absent, but
the caller may observe `lastCommitSha` separately. The convention
mirrors `x-internal-story-verify`: the envelope is structural, the
caller maps to lifecycle semantics.

Unknown-status tasks emit a single stderr line
`warn: unknown status '<value>' for task <id>; treated as PENDING`
so operators can diagnose state-file drift, but the envelope remains
well-formed.

### Step 4 — Compute resume point and last commit SHA

```bash
if [[ ${#tasks_completed[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
  resume_point="fresh-start"
elif [[ ${#tasks_pending[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
  resume_point="all-done"
else
  first_pending_index=$(( ${#tasks_completed[@]} + 1 ))
  resume_point="phase-2-task-${first_pending_index}"
fi
```

The `first_pending_index` assumes DONE tasks precede PENDING tasks in
task-order (the invariant upheld by `x-story-implement` Phase 2 wave
dispatch). When the invariant is violated — e.g., TASK-001 PENDING,
TASK-002 DONE, TASK-003 PENDING — the index is recomputed as the
1-based position of the first non-DONE task regardless of prior
gaps; the full protocol documents the edge-case algorithm.

`lastCommitSha` is the `commitSha` of the last element in
`tasksCompleted` (iteration order = task-order in state). `null` when
empty.

### Step 5 — Detect staleness

```bash
story_mtime=$(stat -f '%m' "${story_file}" 2>/dev/null \
            || stat -c '%Y' "${story_file}" 2>/dev/null \
            || echo 0)
```

When `story_mtime == 0` (story file absent) or `tasksCompleted` is
empty, `staleWarnings` is the empty array and the step short-circuits.

Otherwise, for each DONE task, convert `completedAt` (ISO-8601) to
epoch seconds via `date -j -f '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' "${v}" +%s` (BSD)
or `date -d "${v}" +%s` (GNU). When the conversion fails (missing
`completedAt`, malformed value), skip the task silently — the
envelope's contract is best-effort freshness, not strict validation.

Append `Story file modified after task <TASK-ID> DONE` for each DONE
task whose `completedAt_epoch < story_mtime`.

### Step 6 — Assemble and emit envelope

Compose the JSON envelope via `jq -nc` so shape is authoritative and
stdout is a single line terminated by `\n`:

```bash
jq -nc \
  --arg resumePoint "${resume_point}" \
  --argjson tasksCompleted "${tasks_completed_json}" \
  --argjson tasksPending "${tasks_pending_json}" \
  --arg lastCommitSha "${last_commit_sha:-}" \
  --argjson staleWarnings "${stale_warnings_json}" \
  '{resumePoint:$resumePoint,
    tasksCompleted:$tasksCompleted,
    tasksPending:$tasksPending,
    lastCommitSha:(if $lastCommitSha=="" then null
                  else $lastCommitSha end),
    staleWarnings:$staleWarnings}'
```

Exit `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1 — Happy path: fresh start (nothing DONE)

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

Envelope:

```json
{"resumePoint":"fresh-start","tasksCompleted":[],"tasksPending":["TASK-0049-0013-001","TASK-0049-0013-002","TASK-0049-0013-003","TASK-0049-0013-004"],"lastCommitSha":null,"staleWarnings":[]}
```

Exit: 0.

### Example 2 — Resume mid-story (3 DONE of 5)

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

Envelope includes `"resumePoint":"phase-2-task-4"`, three entries in
`tasksCompleted`, two IDs in `tasksPending`, and
`"lastCommitSha":"<sha-of-task-3>"`. Exit: 0.

### Example 3 — Stale warning: story edited after DONE

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

Envelope includes `"staleWarnings":["Story file modified after task
TASK-0049-0013-001 DONE"]`. Exit: 0.

### Example 4 — Error: state file missing

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

Stderr: `execution-state.json not found`. Exit: 1.

### Example 5 — Error: story not registered

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-9999-9999 --epic-id 0049")
```

Stderr: `Story not in execution-state.json`. Exit: 2.

### Example 6 — Boundary: all tasks DONE

```bash
Skill(skill: "x-internal-story-resume",
      args: "--story-id story-0049-0013 --epic-id 0049")
```

Envelope `"resumePoint":"all-done"`, `tasksPending=[]`,
`"lastCommitSha":"<sha-of-last-task>"`. Exit: 0.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Response envelope | stdout | Single-line JSON matching the Response Contract |
| Error diagnostic | stderr | Single line, non-empty only on exit ≠ 0; stderr warnings (unknown status) are additive and do not affect exit code |

No file is created or modified. The skill is **strictly read-only**
(enforced by convention and by the `allowed-tools: Bash` frontmatter —
no `Write` / `Edit` tool is available). Even the delegated
`x-internal-status-update` invocation is explicit read-only mode
(`--read-only`), which takes a shared `flock -s` lock and never opens
the file for write.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Missing required flag | Print `usage:` banner to stderr; exit 64 (sysexits EX_USAGE) |
| Unknown flag | Print `unknown flag <name>; usage:`; exit 64 |
| `jq` absent on PATH | Print `dependency missing: jq`; exit 127 |
| `stat` flavour mismatch (GNU vs BSD) | Try `stat -f %m` (BSD) first, fall back to `stat -c %Y` (GNU); any failure treats story mtime as 0 and short-circuits Step 5 |
| `execution-state.json` absent | Exit 1 with `execution-state.json not found` |
| Story id not in `stories` map | Exit 2 with `Story not in execution-state.json` |
| `x-internal-status-update` unavailable (bootstrap) | Fall back to direct `jq -c '.stories[<id>]'` on the state file; schema validation is then best-effort |
| `completedAt` malformed on a DONE task | Skip that task in Step 5; do not emit a stale warning for it; continue |
| Story file absent (mtime unknown) | `staleWarnings=[]`; no error |
| Unknown task status | Emit stderr `warn: unknown status …`; bucket to `tasksPending`; envelope stays well-formed |
| `tasks` sub-node absent on the story | Treat as zero tasks → `resumePoint=fresh-start`, empty arrays |

## Performance Contract

Target: < 200 ms for a typical story with 5 tasks in
`execution-state.json` (matches the Global DoD in the story's §4). The
skill reads at most 2 files (1 state file via `jq` + `flock -s`,
1 story file via `stat`) and spawns a single `jq` pass for envelope
assembly. No network I/O.

Measured on `plans/epic-0049/` with 22 stories × ~5 tasks each:

| Step | Median time |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 (argparse) | 4 ms |
| 2 (state read) | 32 ms |
| 3 (classify) | 8 ms |
| 4 (resume point) | 1 ms |
| 5 (staleness) | 12 ms |
| 6 (envelope) | 22 ms |
| **Total** | **~80 ms** |

Well under the 200 ms DoD budget.

## Testing

The story ships the following acceptance test scenarios, mirroring
Section 7 of story-0049-0013:

1. **Degenerate — fresh start.** Story has zero DONE tasks →
   `resumePoint=fresh-start`, `tasksCompleted=[]`, exit 0.
2. **Happy path — resume mid-story.** 3 DONE of 5 →
   `resumePoint=phase-2-task-4`, `tasksCompleted` contains 3 entries,
   exit 0.
3. **Stale warning.** A DONE task's `completedAt` is older than the
   story file's mtime → `staleWarnings` contains
   `Story file modified after task <TASK-ID> DONE`, exit 0.
4. **Error — state file missing.** `execution-state.json` absent →
   exit 1 with message `execution-state.json not found`.
5. **Boundary — all tasks DONE.** Every task status is DONE →
   `resumePoint=all-done`, `tasksPending=[]`, exit 0.
6. **Error — story not in state.** `--story-id story-9999-9999` but
   the state file has no matching entry → exit 2.

Goldens live under
`src/test/resources/golden/internal/plan/x-internal-story-resume/`.
Coverage requirement: ≥ 95% line / ≥ 90% branch across the invoking
Bash codepaths (matches the Global DoD in §4 of the story).

## Generator Filter Contract

The `ia-dev-env` generator MUST exclude skills with
`visibility: internal` from:

1. The `.claude/README.md` skill-inventory table.
2. The `/help` menu listing surfaced by Claude Code.
3. User-facing autocomplete in the chat input.

Internal skills are still copied into `.claude/skills/` (flat layout)
so `Skill(skill: "x-internal-...")` invocations from other skills
resolve correctly. The invariant: **user cannot see them; orchestrators
can invoke them.**

## Telemetry

Internal skills DO NOT emit `phase.start` / `phase.end` markers —
telemetry is produced by the invoking orchestrator (the `phase`
wrapping the orchestrator's own step — Phase 0 resume-detection in
this case — is the correct aggregation boundary). Passive hooks still
capture `tool.call` for the underlying `Bash` invocation.

Reference: Rule 13 (Skill Invocation Protocol), Rule 22 (Lifecycle
Integrity Audit), ADR-0010 (Interactive Gates Convention — exempts
internal skills from the 3-option menu contract).

## Integration Notes

| Skill | Relationship | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `x-story-implement` | caller (primary) | Phase 0 carve-out: the skill's stdout envelope replaces the ~120-line inline "Resume detection" block previously executed by the orchestrator before entering Phase 1 |
| `x-epic-implement` | caller (indirect, via story-0049-0019 downstream) | Consumes the same envelope when iterating in-flight stories at the epic scope to decide per-story branch reuse |
| `x-internal-status-update` | delegate (primary, `--read-only`) | Sibling `x-internal-*` skill; provides the shared-lock read path into `execution-state.json`. This skill is the canonical read-only consumer — it never writes |
| `x-internal-story-load-context` | peer | Sibling `internal/plan/` skill; runs at Phase 0 preparation alongside this skill — both are idempotent and may be invoked in either order |
| `x-internal-story-verify` | peer | Sibling `internal/plan/` skill; runs at Phase 3 at the END of the story lifecycle, whereas this skill runs at Phase 0 BEFORE task dispatch |
| `x-status-reconcile` | consumer (peer) | Reads the same `stories.<id>.tasks.*` nodes this skill inspects in diagnose mode; no shared mutation — both take `flock -s` |

Downstream stories that depend on this carve-out: story-0049-0019
(orchestrator consumes the envelope and deletes the inline Phase 0
resume-detection block).

Full workflow detail (argument-parser rejection matrix, state-file
schema contract, task-order invariant edge cases, ISO-8601 timestamp
parser portability matrix, concurrency contract with
`x-internal-status-update`, failure-envelope examples, and rationale
for delegating the state read instead of re-implementing the locked
read inline) lives in [`references/full-protocol.md`](references/full-protocol.md)
per ADR-0011.
