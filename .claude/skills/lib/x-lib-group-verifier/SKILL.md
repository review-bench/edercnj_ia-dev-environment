# Skill: Group Verifier (Library)

## Purpose

Runs between each parallelism group (G1-G7) during Phase 2 of the feature lifecycle. Compiles the code, classifies any errors, decides whether to retry or escalate, and extracts created file contents for the next group's dependency inputs.

## When Called

| Caller Skill | Phase | Context |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| x-story-implement | Phase 2 | After each group completes, BEFORE starting the next group |
| x-task-implement | Implementation | Inline build gate between layer groups |

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Group ID | `G1\|G2\|G3\|G4\|G5\|G6\|G7` | The parallelism group to verify |
| Task outputs | File list | Files created/modified by tasks in the completed group |

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Compile

```bash
{{COMPILE_COMMAND}}
```

Capture: exit code + stderr output.

For G7 (Tests group), use the full build command instead:

```bash
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}
```

### Step 2 — Analyze

- If exit code = 0 -> Go to STEP 5 (success)
- If exit code != 0 -> Parse error output, go to STEP 3

### Step 3 — Classify Errors

Classify errors based on the {{LANGUAGE}} compiler/interpreter output. The patterns below are common across languages — adapt to the specific error messages produced by your toolchain:

| Error Category                                        | Classification     | Meaning                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Missing type/symbol from a PREVIOUS group              | MISSING_DEPENDENCY | Previous group regression         |
| Missing type/symbol from the CURRENT group             | TASK_ERROR         | Current task produced bad code    |
| Type mismatch / incompatible types                    | TASK_ERROR         | Wrong types in current task       |
| Missing package/module from previous group             | MISSING_DEPENDENCY | Previous group incomplete         |
| Missing external dependency                            | BUILD_ERROR        | Missing dependency in build file  |
| Interface/contract mismatch                           | TASK_ERROR         | Implementation doesn't match port |
| Unhandled error/exception                             | TASK_ERROR         | Missing error handling            |
| Any other error                                       | UNKNOWN            | Needs investigation               |

### Step 4 — Decide

| Classification     | Attempt | Action                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| TASK_ERROR         | 1st     | RETRY same tier, add error message to prompt      |
| TASK_ERROR         | 2nd     | RETRY same tier, add both errors to prompt        |
| TASK_ERROR         | 3rd     | ESCALATE to next tier (Junior->Mid, Mid->Senior)  |
| MISSING_DEPENDENCY | any     | HALT pipeline, flag previous group regression     |
| BUILD_ERROR        | any     | HALT pipeline, report missing dependency          |
| UNKNOWN            | 1st     | ESCALATE immediately to next tier                 |
| UNKNOWN            | 2nd     | HALT pipeline, flag for manual intervention       |

**Escalation path:** Junior -> Mid -> Senior -> Manual intervention

**When retrying a task:**
1. Re-read the output from the failed attempt
2. Add to the retry prompt: `## COMPILATION ERROR\n{error message}\n## FIX INSTRUCTIONS\nThe previous attempt produced this error. Fix it.`
3. Re-launch with the same tier (or escalated tier)

### Step 5 — Extract Outputs

For each task in the completed group:
1. Read all files listed in `task.files_created`
2. Read all files listed in `task.files_modified`
3. Store content for use as dependency inputs in subsequent groups

### Step 6 — Commit

After successful compilation:

```bash
git add {all files from this group}
git commit -m "{group commit message}"
```

Group commit messages follow Conventional Commits format (see `rules/06-git-conventions.md` for scopes):

```
feat({scope}): add {group description} for STORY-ID
```

Derive the `{scope}` from the architecture layer being committed. The scopes table in `rules/06-git-conventions.md` defines the valid scopes for your project. Example pattern:
- G1: `feat(domain): add foundation models and migration for STORY-ID`
- G2: `feat(domain): add ports, DTOs, and engine for STORY-ID`
- G3-G5: Use the scope matching the adapter layer (e.g., `persistence`, `api`, `config`)
- G6: `feat(observability): add tracing and metrics for STORY-ID`
- G7: `test: add tests for STORY-ID`

### Step 7 — Report

```
Group G{N} verified: {PASS|FAIL}
  Tasks: {N} completed, {N} retried, {N} escalated
  Files: {N} created, {N} modified
  Warnings: {N}
  {If escalation: "ESCALATION: T{X} from {tier} -> {next_tier} (reason: {error})"}
```

## G7 Extended Verification

G7 uses `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}` instead of `{{COMPILE_COMMAND}}`:

Additional checks:
1. Parse test results from build reports
2. Count: tests, failures, errors, skipped
3. Parse coverage report
4. Verify: line coverage >= 95%, branch coverage >= 90%

If tests fail:
- Classify failing tests by the task that created them
- Retry the test task with the failure message
- If test depends on production code from another task, check production code first

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Compilation fails with TASK_ERROR (1st attempt) | Retry same tier with error message in prompt |
| Compilation fails with TASK_ERROR (2nd attempt) | Retry same tier with both errors in prompt |
| Compilation fails with TASK_ERROR (3rd attempt) | Escalate to next tier (Junior -> Mid -> Senior) |
| MISSING_DEPENDENCY detected | Halt pipeline, flag previous group regression |
| BUILD_ERROR (missing external dependency) | Halt pipeline, report missing dependency in build file |
| UNKNOWN error (1st attempt) | Escalate immediately to next tier |
| UNKNOWN error (2nd attempt) | Halt pipeline, flag for manual intervention |
| Senior-tier escalation exhausted | Halt pipeline, flag for manual intervention |

## Integration Notes

| Skill | Relationship | Context |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| x-story-implement | called-by | Invoked during Phase 2 after each group |
| x-task-implement | called-by | Build gate between layer groups during implementation |

- Uses `{{COMPILE_COMMAND}}` for G1-G6, `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}` for G7
- Produces atomic commits per group (rollback points)
