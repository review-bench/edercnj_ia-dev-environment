## What It Does

Creates Jira Stories from all local `story-XXXX-YYYY.md` files in an epic directory. Processes stories in dependency order, links each to its parent epic, creates Jira issue links for inter-story dependencies (Blocks relationship), and syncs Jira keys back to local files and the implementation map. Skips stories that already have Jira keys and supports partial execution on failure.

## Usage

```
/x-jira-create-stories plans/epic-0012
/x-jira-create-stories 0012
```

## Workflow

1. **Discover** -- Accept epic directory or ID, glob for story files
2. **Parse** -- Extract title, ID, description, value delivery, and dependencies from each story
3. **Filter** -- Classify stories as already-in-Jira or to-create, confirm with user
4. **Epic Link** -- Resolve parent epic Jira key for linking
5. **Project** -- Discover Atlassian sites and prompt user to select a Jira project
6. **Create** -- Create stories in dependency order via MCP, sync keys to local files
7. **Link** -- Second pass to create Blocks dependency links between stories

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Updated story files | `plans/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md` (Jira key synced) |
| Updated implementation map | `plans/epic-XXXX/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` (Jira keys added) |
