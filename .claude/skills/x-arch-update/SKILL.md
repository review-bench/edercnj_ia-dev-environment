# Skill: Service Architecture Document Updater

## Purpose

Incrementally updates the service architecture document (`steering/service-architecture.md`) with changes from architecture plans. Adds new components, integrations, flows, and ADR references without rewriting existing content.

## Triggers

- `/x-arch-update [STORY-ID]` — update architecture doc from the architecture plan for the given story
- `/x-arch-update [architecture-plan-path]` — update architecture doc from the specified plan file
- After a feature is implemented and an architecture plan exists
- When Phase 3 (Documentation) of `x-story-implement` is executing
- SKIP when no architecture plan exists for the feature

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `STORY-ID` | String | Yes (or path) | Story identifier to locate the architecture plan |
| `architecture-plan-path` | String | Yes (or ID) | Direct path to the architecture plan file |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Read Inputs

1. Read the architecture plan at the path provided as argument
2. Read the current service architecture doc at `steering/service-architecture.md`
3. If `service-architecture.md` does NOT exist, read the template from `resources/templates/_TEMPLATE-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md` and create the initial document by replacing `{{ placeholders }}` with project identity values

### Step 2 — Identify Changes

1. Compare the architecture plan sections against the current service architecture doc
2. For each section, identify: new components, new integrations, new flows, new ADRs, changed NFRs, new observability or resilience configurations
3. Build a diff list of changes per section

### Step 3 — Apply Incremental Updates (RULE-008 — Content Preservation)

For each changed section, INSERT new content at the appropriate location. NEVER remove or rewrite existing content.

| # | Section Heading | Update Action |
|---|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 1. Overview | Append new interfaces or technology changes |
| 2 | 2. C4 Diagrams | Add new nodes and edges to existing Mermaid diagrams |
| 3 | 3. Integrations | Append new rows to the integration table |
| 4 | 4. Data Model | Add new entities and relationships to the ER diagram |
| 5 | 5. Critical Flows | Add new sequence diagrams as new subsections |
| 6 | 6. NFRs | Update targets only if changed; never remove rows |
| 7 | 7. Architectural Decisions | Append new ADR references to the table |
| 8 | 8. Observability | Add new metrics, alerts, or dashboard entries |
| 9 | 9. Resilience | Add new circuit breaker, retry, or fallback configurations |
| 10 | 10. Change History | Append a new changelog entry with date, story ID, and summary |

#### Content Preservation Rules

- NEVER remove existing content from any section
- NEVER rewrite a section — only insert or append
- If a component was refactored: mark old as deprecated, add new
- If a flow changed: add new version, mark previous as "v1"
- Merge conflicts: preserve both versions

#### Change History Entry Format

| Date | Author | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | AI (story-XXXX-YYYY) | Sections affected: [list]. Summary: [brief description] |

### Step 4 — Update Change History

ALWAYS append a new row to Section 10 (Change History). Include: today's date, story ID, list of sections modified, brief summary.

### Step 5 — Save

1. Write the updated document to `steering/service-architecture.md`
2. Report: sections updated, changes applied, new entries added

## Document Creation from Scratch

If `steering/service-architecture.md` does NOT exist:

1. Read the template from `resources/templates/_TEMPLATE-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Replace `{{ placeholders }}` with project identity values
3. Populate sections from the architecture plan data
4. Add an initial Change History entry

## Template Fallback

If `resources/templates/_TEMPLATE-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md` is not found, create a minimal service architecture document with 10 numbered sections and populate from the architecture plan. Log a warning: `"Template not found; using inline fallback structure."`

## Subagent Prompt

Launch a **single** `general-purpose` subagent:

> You are a **Documentation Engineer** performing an incremental update of the
> service architecture document for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
>
> **Step 1 — Read inputs:**
> - Read the architecture plan at the path provided as argument
> - Read the current service architecture doc at `steering/service-architecture.md`
> - If `service-architecture.md` does NOT exist, read the template from
>   `resources/templates/_TEMPLATE-SERVICE-ARCHITECTURE.md` and create the initial document
>   by replacing `{{ placeholders }}` with project identity values
>
> **Step 2 — Identify changes:**
> - Compare the architecture plan sections against the current service architecture doc
> - For each section, identify: new components, new integrations, new flows, new ADRs,
>   changed NFRs, new observability or resilience configurations
> - Build a diff list of changes per section
>
> **Step 3 — Apply incremental updates (RULE-008):**
> - For each changed section, INSERT new content at the appropriate location
> - NEVER remove or rewrite existing content
> - For C4 diagrams: add new Mermaid nodes and edges within existing graph blocks
> - For tables: append new rows
> - For sequence diagrams: add new subsections with new diagrams
> - For ADR references: append new rows to the ADR table
>
> **Step 4 — Update Change History:**
> - ALWAYS append a new row to Section 10 (Change History)
> - Include: today's date, story ID, list of sections modified, brief summary
>
> **Step 5 — Save:**
> - Write the updated document to `steering/service-architecture.md`
> - Report: sections updated, changes applied, new entries added
>
> **Conventions:**
> - All content in English (RULE-012)
> - Mermaid syntax for all diagrams
> - Incremental updates only — never full rewrite (RULE-008)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Architecture plan not found | Skip with log: "No architecture plan found; skipping architecture doc update" |
| Service architecture doc not found | Create from template (see Document Creation from Scratch) |
| Template not found | Use inline fallback structure, log warning |
| Section heading mismatch | Match by numeric prefix, warn if heading text differs |
| Merge conflict in Mermaid diagram | Preserve both versions, add comment marking conflict |

## Integration Notes

| Skill | Relationship | Context |

| `x-story-implement` | called-by | Invoked during Phase 3 (Documentation) to update architecture doc |
| `x-arch-plan` | reads | Generates the input architecture plans consumed by this skill |
| `x-adr-generate` | calls | May trigger ADR generation for new architectural decisions |
| `architecture` | reads | References architecture principles and patterns KP |
