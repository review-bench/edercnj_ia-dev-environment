## What It Does

Keeps the service architecture document (`steering/service-architecture.md`) up to date by applying incremental changes from architecture plans. It never removes or rewrites existing content -- only inserts new components, integrations, flows, ADR references, and changelog entries. If the document does not exist, it bootstraps one from a template.

## Usage

```
/x-arch-update story-0012-0003
/x-arch-update plans/epic-0012/plans/architecture-story-0012-0003.md
```

## Workflow

1. Read the architecture plan and current service architecture document
2. If `service-architecture.md` does not exist, create it from template
3. Identify changes by comparing plan sections against the current document
4. Apply incremental updates (insert new content, never remove existing)
5. Append a changelog entry to Section 10 (Change History)
6. Save the updated document and report sections modified

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Service architecture document | `steering/service-architecture.md` |
