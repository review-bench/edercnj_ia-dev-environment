# Skill: Run Tests

## Purpose

Testing is critical in {{PROJECT_NAME}}. The project enforces strict coverage thresholds (line >= 95%, branch >= 90%). This skill guides test execution, coverage analysis, and gap identification.

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# All tests
{{TEST_COMMAND}}

# With coverage report
{{COVERAGE_COMMAND}}

# Specific test class (adapt to your build tool)
# Example: mvn test -Dtest=ClassName
# Example: ./gradlew test --tests ClassName
```

## Coverage Thresholds

| Metric          | Minimum |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Line Coverage   | >= 95%  |
| Branch Coverage | >= 90%  |

## Test Structure

For full testing philosophy (8 test categories, data uniqueness, fixture patterns), read `knowledge/testing/testing-philosophy.md`.

### Naming Convention

```
[methodUnderTest]_[scenario]_[expectedBehavior]
```

Examples:
- `processTransaction_approvedAmount_returnsSuccess`
- `findById_nonExistent_returnsEmpty`
- `validate_nullInput_throwsException`

### Test Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

Every test method follows AAA with clear separation:

```
// Arrange -- setup objects and data
// Act -- execute the method under test
// Assert -- verify the outcome
```

## Test Categories

| Category        | When to Use                                    | Tools                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Unit            | Domain logic, engines, mappers                 | Test framework + assertions|
| Integration     | DB interactions, framework features            | Framework test support     |
| API             | REST endpoints                                 | HTTP test client           |
| E2E             | Full flow (request -> process -> persist -> response) | Integration framework |
| Contract        | Protocol/format compliance                     | Parametrized tests         |
| Performance     | Latency SLAs, throughput                       | Load testing framework     |

## Coverage Analysis

After running `{{COVERAGE_COMMAND}}`, analyze the coverage report.

### Common Coverage Gaps and Solutions

| Gap                           | Solution                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Uncovered `else` branch       | Add test for the negative case                   |
| Uncovered exception path      | Test error paths with exception assertions        |
| Uncovered `default` in switch | Add test with unexpected input                   |
| Uncovered record accessor     | Usually covered indirectly; add direct test if not|
| Uncovered validation          | Test with invalid inputs                         |

### Per-Class Coverage Report Format

```
+--------------------------+-------+--------+
|          Class           | Line  | Branch |
+--------------------------+-------+--------+
| ClassA                   | 100%  | 95.0%  |
+--------------------------+-------+--------+
| ClassB                   | 97.3% | 88.5%  |
+--------------------------+-------+--------+

Tests: XX passing, XX failing, XX errors, XX skipped
Global Coverage: XX% line / XX% branch
```

## Assertion Rules

Read `knowledge/testing/testing-conventions.md` for {{LANGUAGE}}-specific test frameworks and assertion libraries.

- Use the project's standard assertion library (e.g., AssertJ, Hamcrest)
- NEVER use basic assertEquals/assertTrue if a fluent assertion library is available
- Test exception paths with `assertThatThrownBy` or equivalent
- Test Optional results with `isPresent()`/`isEmpty()`

## Test Data

### Fixture Pattern

Centralize test data in utility classes:
- `final class` + `private` constructor + `static` methods
- Naming: `a{Entity}()` or `a{Entity}With{Variation}()`
- Constants for default values
- Domain fixtures separate from protocol/format fixtures

### Data Uniqueness

Tests that create resources (POST/INSERT) MUST generate unique identifiers to avoid conflicts between test runs.

## Traceability Matrix (--traceability flag)

When invoked with `--traceability [STORY-ID|EPIC-ID]`, generates a bidirectional requirement-to-test mapping report.

### Usage

```bash
# Single story traceability
/x-test-run --traceability STORY-0007-0003

# Epic-wide traceability (consolidates all stories)
/x-test-run --traceability EPIC-0007
```

### Output

Generates `results/traceability/traceability-{ID}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` containing:

1. **Requirement -> Test -> Execution** table mapping each @GK-N scenario to its test class, method, status (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), and line coverage
2. **Unmapped Requirements** — scenarios with no corresponding test
3. **Unmapped Tests** — test methods not linked to any story scenario
4. **Coverage Summary** — stories covered, scenarios covered, pass/skip/fail counts

### Traceability Matrix Format

```markdown
# Traceability Matrix — STORY-XXXX-YYYY
Generated: YYYY-MM-DD | Build: <commit-hash>

## Requirement -> Test -> Execution

| Req ID | Scenario | Test Class | Method | Status | Line Cov |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| AT-1   | scenario | TestClass  | method | PASS   | 94%      |

## Unmapped Requirements
- AT-N: description

## Unmapped Tests
- TestClass.method -> not linked to any story scenario

## Coverage Summary
- Stories covered: N/M
- Scenarios covered: N/M (X%)
- Scenarios PASS: N | SKIP: N | FAIL: N
```

### Epic Consolidation

For EPIC-ID, the matrix consolidates all stories in the epic with one section per story and a global summary at the end with aggregated totals.

## Integration Notes

- Invoked by `x-story-implement` during Phase 2 (G7) and Phase 4
- Invoked by `x-task-implement` during Step 4
- Coverage report consumed by `x-review` skill (QA engineer)
- Thresholds enforced by `x-lib-group-verifier` in G7 verification
