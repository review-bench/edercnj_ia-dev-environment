# Knowledge Pack: Coding Standards

## Purpose

Provides the complete coding conventions for {{LANGUAGE}} {{LANGUAGE_VERSION}} with {{FRAMEWORK}}. Includes Clean Code rules, SOLID principles, language-specific idioms, formatting rules, and library guidelines.

## Quick Reference (always in context)

See `rules/03-coding-standards.md` for the essential cheat sheet (hard limits, naming, SOLID one-liners, forbidden patterns).

## Detailed References
