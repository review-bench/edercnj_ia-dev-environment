# Knowledge Pack: Compliance

## Purpose

Provides compliance framework guidance for {{LANGUAGE}} {{FRAMEWORK}} projects subject to regulatory requirements. Includes data classification schemes, enforcement of data subject rights, processing record management, international transfer controls, security measure implementation, and audit logging patterns. Frameworks included based on project configuration: GDPR, HIPAA, LGPD, PCI-DSS, SOX.

## Quick Reference (always in context)

See `skills/security/references/security-principles.md` for the security and data classification summary (data classification, sensitive data handling, fail-secure patterns).
