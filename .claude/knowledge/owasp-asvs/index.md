# Knowledge Pack: OWASP ASVS 4.0.3

## Purpose

Provides the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 4.0.3 as a structured reference for security verification. Maps verification items across 14 chapters with three assurance levels, cross-referenced to OWASP Top 10, CIS Controls v8, NIST CSF, and SANS Top 25.

## ASVS Levels Overview

| Level | Name | Applicability | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| L1 | Opportunistic | All applications | Minimum baseline covering the most critical CWEs. Achievable via automated tooling and code review. |
| L2 | Standard | Most applications | Covers the majority of CWEs. Recommended for applications handling sensitive data, business-critical transactions, or healthcare/financial information. |
| L3 | Advanced | Critical applications | Defense-in-depth for high-value targets: military, financial infrastructure, healthcare systems. Requires architecture review and threat modeling. |

**Level hierarchy:** L1 is a subset of L2, and L2 is a subset of L3. Every L3-compliant application also satisfies L2 and L1.
