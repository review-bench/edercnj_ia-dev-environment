# Knowledge Pack: Architecture

## Purpose

Provides the complete architecture principles for {{ARCHITECTURE}} ({{ARCH_STYLE}}). Includes package structure, dependency rules, layer responsibilities, mapper patterns, persistence rules, and architecture variants.

## Quick Reference (always in context)

See `rules/04-architecture-summary.md` for the essential cheat sheet (dependency direction, package structure, layer rules).
