# Knowledge Pack: Infrastructure

## Purpose

Provides infrastructure and deployment patterns for {{LANGUAGE}} {{FRAMEWORK}}, enabling cloud-agnostic, cloud-native service deployment. Covers container best practices (multi-stage Docker), Kubernetes manifests (Kustomize-based), security hardening, 12-Factor compliance, health probes, graceful shutdown, resource management, and observability integration.

## Quick Reference (always in context)

See `references/infrastructure-principles.md` for the essential infrastructure summary (cloud-agnostic, IaC, health probes, graceful shutdown, security context).
