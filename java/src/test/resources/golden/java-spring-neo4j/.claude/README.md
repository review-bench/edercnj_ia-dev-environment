# .claude/ -- Usage Guide

This directory contains all Claude Code configuration for the **my-spring-neo4j** project.
It includes coding rules, skills (slash commands), knowledge packs, agents, and hooks.

> **Note:** The `.claude/` directory is a **generated output** produced by `ia-dev-env`.
> Do not edit it manually -- regenerate instead.

> The `CLAUDE.md` file at the project root provides an executive summary loaded automatically in EVERY conversation.

## Structure

```
CLAUDE.md                   <-- Executive summary (project root, loaded automatically)
.claude/
|-- README.md               <-- You are here
|-- settings.json           <-- Shared settings (committed to git)
|-- settings.local.json     <-- Local overrides (gitignored)
|-- hooks/                  <-- Automations (post-compile, etc.)
|-- rules/                  <-- Project rules (loaded into system prompt)
|-- skills/                 <-- Skills invocable via /command
|   +-- {knowledge-packs}/  <-- Knowledge packs (not invocable, referenced internally)
+-- agents/                 <-- AI personas (used by skills and lifecycle)
```

## Platform Selection

The generator currently produces Claude Code artifacts only. Support for `copilot`, `codex`, and the generic `agents` target was removed (see EPIC-0034). Legacy `--platform` values are rejected by the CLI.

| Value | Description | Directories Generated |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `claude-code` | Anthropic Claude Code (only accepted value) | `.claude/` + docs |

### CLI Examples

```bash
# Generate Claude Code artifacts (default behavior)
ia-dev-env generate --platform claude-code --config my-config.yaml

# Platform flag can be omitted — claude-code is the only supported target
ia-dev-env generate --config my-config.yaml
```

### YAML Configuration

You can also specify the platform in your YAML config file:

```yaml
platform: claude-code
```

### Default Behavior

When no `--platform` flag is provided and no `platform:` key exists in the YAML config, the generator produces artifacts for `claude-code` (the only supported target). Any legacy value (`copilot`, `codex`, `agents`, `all`) is rejected with a clear error message.

### settings.json vs settings.local.json

- **`settings.json`**: Team settings (permissions, hooks). Committed to git.
- **`settings.local.json`**: Local overrides. In `.gitignore`. Overrides `settings.json`.

## Skills (Slash Commands)

Skills are invoked by the user via `/name` in chat. They are lazy-loaded (only load when invoked).

| Skill | Path | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **patterns** | `/patterns` |  |
| **x-adr-generate** | `/x-adr-generate` | Automates ADR generation from architecture plan mini-ADRs: extracts inline decisions, expands to full ADR format, assigns sequential numbering, updates the ADR index, and adds cross-references. |
| **x-arch-plan** | `/x-arch-plan` | Generates a comprehensive architecture plan with component diagrams, sequence diagrams, deployment topology, mini-ADRs, NFRs, and resilience/observability strategies. Use before implementation to document design decisions. |
| **x-arch-update** | `/x-arch-update` | Incrementally updates the service architecture document with changes from architecture plans. Adds new components, integrations, flows, and ADR references without rewriting existing content. Use after implementation to keep architecture documentation current. |
| **x-ci-generate** | `/x-ci-generate` | Generate or update CI/CD pipelines based on project stack: detect language, analyze existing workflows, generate CI/CD/release/security pipelines, validate with actionlint, support monorepo triggers. |
| **x-code-audit** | `/x-code-audit` | Full codebase review against all project standards. Launches parallel subagents per audit dimension (Clean Code, SOLID, Architecture, Tests, Security, Cross-file), consolidates findings into a severity-categorized report with score. Use for periodic quality validation. |
| **x-code-format** | `/x-code-format` | Formats source code using the appropriate formatter for {{LANGUAGE}}. First step of the pre-commit chain (format -> lint -> compile -> commit). Supports --check (dry-run) and --changed-only modes. |
| **x-code-lint** | `/x-code-lint` | Analyzes source code with the appropriate linter for {{LANGUAGE}}. Second step in the pre-commit chain (RULE-007: format -> lint -> compile -> commit). Supports --fix, --changed-only, and --strict modes. |
| **x-dependency-audit** | `/x-dependency-audit` | Checks project dependencies for vulnerabilities, outdated versions, and license issues. Detects build tool automatically, runs language-specific audit commands, and generates a severity-categorized report. |
| **x-doc-generate** | `/x-doc-generate` | Documentation automation: detects documentation type needed (API, README, ADR, changelog) from code changes, delegates to specialized skills or generates inline. Single entry point for all documentation updates. |
| **x-epic-create** | `/x-epic-create` | Generate an Epic document from a system specification file with cross-cutting business rules, global quality definitions (DoR/DoD), a complete story index with dependency declarations, and optional Jira integration. |
| **x-epic-decompose** | `/x-epic-decompose` | Complete decomposition of a system specification into an Epic, individual Story files, and an Implementation Map with dependency graph and phased execution plan. Orchestrates spec analysis, rule extraction, story identification, and implementation planning. |
| **x-epic-implement** | `/x-epic-implement` | Thin orchestrator (~460 lines — story-0049-0018 refactor) that drives an epic end-to-end via 6 delegated phases: Phase 0 (args via x-internal-args-normalize), Phase 1 (load+plan via x-internal-epic-build-plan), Phase 2 (epic branch via x-internal-epic-branch-ensure), Phase 3 (sequential-by-default story loop via x-story-implement), Phase 4 (integrity gate + report via x-internal-epic-integrity-gate + x-internal-report-write), Phase 5 (final PR epic/XXXX → develop via x-git-merge + x-pr-create). Defaults flipped by EPIC-0049: sequential execution (opt-in parallel via --parallel), auto-merge of story PRs into epic/XXXX (target changed from develop). Legacy EPIC-0042 behavior preserved under --legacy-flow (auto-detected via execution-state.json flowVersion=1). Zero inline git/gh/jq/mvn calls — orchestrator uses only Read/Glob + Skill. |
| **x-epic-map** | `/x-epic-map` | Generate an Implementation Map from an Epic and its Stories with dependency matrix, phase computation, critical path analysis, ASCII phase diagrams, Mermaid dependency graphs, phase summary tables, and strategic observations. |

| **x-git-branch** | `/x-git-branch` | Creates a bare git branch (no worktree) from a configurable base with naming validation and idempotency. Single source of truth for branch creation logic consumed by orchestrators (x-internal-epic-branch-ensure, x-story-implement) and users. |
| **x-git-cleanup-branches** | `/x-git-cleanup-branches` | Cleans local git state in one pass: fetches origin with prune, removes all non-main worktrees (any path), and deletes all local branches except main/master/develop. Destructive by default with an interactive y/N confirmation gate; supports --dry-run (preview) and --yes (non-interactive). |
| **x-git-commit** | `/x-git-commit` | Creates Conventional Commits with Task ID in scope and pre-commit chain (format -> lint -> compile). Central commit point in the task-centric workflow with TDD tag support. |
| **x-git-merge** | `/x-git-merge` | Merges a source branch into a target branch locally with configurable strategy (merge/squash/rebase), automatic conflict detection + rollback, and idempotent no-op when target already contains source HEAD. Centralizes the ~120 lines of inline Bash previously in x-epic-implement Phase 1.4e auto-rebase. |
| **x-git-push** | `/x-git-push` | Git operations: branch creation, atomic commits (Conventional Commits), push, and PR creation. Use for any git workflow task including branching, committing, pushing, creating PRs, or managing version control. |
| **x-git-worktree** | `/x-git-worktree` | Manages git worktrees for parallel task and story execution. Operations: create, list, remove, cleanup, detect-context. Follows Rule 14 (Worktree Lifecycle) naming convention under .claude/worktrees/{identifier}/. |

Read all story files in an epic directory, map fields to Jira, create issues with parent epic link, create dependency links between stories, and sync Jira keys back to local files. |
| **x-mcp-recommend** | `/x-mcp-recommend` | Analyzes project tech stack and recommends relevant MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Auto-detects language, framework, database, cache, and message broker from project config, then matches against a built-in catalog of MCP servers with installation instructions. |
| **x-ops-incident** | `/x-ops-incident` | Guides incident response with severity-based checklists, communication templates, and postmortem triggers. Interactive guide for SEV1-SEV4 incidents covering classification, response coordination, and action item tracking. |
| **x-ops-troubleshoot** | `/x-ops-troubleshoot` | Diagnoses errors, stacktraces, build failures, and unexpected behavior. Systematic approach: reproduce, locate, understand, fix, verify.

Extracted from x-epic-implement Phase 1.3b to provide a testable, reusable merge primitive callable from x-pr-create --auto-merge and x-epic-implement. |
| **x-pr-merge-train** | `/x-pr-merge-train` | Merge-train automation: discovers, validates, and merges a sequence of PRs into develop in deterministic order. Supports --prs, --epic, and --pattern discovery modes with pre-merge validation and dry-run auditing. |
| **x-pr-watch-ci** | `/x-pr-watch-ci` | Polls a PR's CI checks and Copilot review status, blocking until checks complete or timeout. Returns one of 8 stable exit codes (SUCCESS=0, CI_PENDING_PROCEED=10, CI_FAILED=20, TIMEOUT=30, PR_ALREADY_MERGED=40, NO_CI_CONFIGURED=50, PR_CLOSED=60, PR_NOT_FOUND=70). Writes a versioned state-file for session resume. |
| **x-release** | `/x-release` | Orchestrates complete release flow using Git Flow release branches with approval gate, PR-flow (gh CLI) and deep validation: version bump (auto-detect or explicit), release branch creation from develop, deep validation (coverage, golden files, version consistency), version file updates, changelog generation, release commit, release PR via gh (optionally reviewed by x-review-pr), human approval gate with persistent state file, tag on main after merged PR, back-merge PR to develop with conflict detection, and cleanup. Supports hotfix releases from main, dry-run mode, resume via --continue-after-merge, in-session pause via --interactive, GPG-signed tags, skip-review opt-out, and custom state file path. |
| **x-release-changelog** | `/x-release-changelog` | Generates CHANGELOG.md from Conventional Commits history. Parses git log, groups by commit type, maps to Keep a Changelog sections (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.), and performs incremental updates preserving existing entries. |
| **x-review** | `/x-review` | Parallel code review with specialist engineers (Security, QA, Performance, Database, Observability, DevOps, API, Event). Invokes individual review skills in parallel via Skill tool, then consolidates into a scored report. Use for pre-PR quality validation. |
| **x-review-api** | `/x-review-api` | Validates REST API endpoints for RFC 7807 error responses, pagination, URL versioning, OpenAPI documentation, status codes, and DTO patterns. |
| **x-review-devops** | `/x-review-devops` | DevOps specialist review: validates Dockerfile, container security, CI/CD pipeline, resource limits, health probes, graceful shutdown, and deployment configuration. |

| **x-runtime-eval** | `/x-runtime-eval` | Evaluate runtime protection controls: rate limiting, WAF rules, bot protection, DDoS mitigation, account lockout, brute force protection, CSP enforcement, and permissions policy. Produce SARIF 2.1.0 output with ASVS compliance mapping and scored Markdown report. |
| **x-security-dashboard** | `/x-security-dashboard` | Aggregates results from all security scanning skills into a unified posture view with score 0-100, trend tracking, OWASP risk heatmap, per-dimension breakdown, and remediation priority queue. Never executes scans — reads existing results only (RULE-011). |
| **x-security-pipeline** | `/x-security-pipeline` | Generate CI/CD pipeline configurations with conditional security stages based on SecurityConfig flags. Support GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Azure DevOps with minimal and full stage modes, configurable severity thresholds, and SARIF artifact upload. |
| **x-setup-env** | `/x-setup-env` | Validate and configure local development environment: detect stack, check prerequisites, verify versions, validate IDE config, test database connectivity, run initial build, and report status with fix suggestions. |
| **x-spec-drift** | `/x-spec-drift` | Detects spec-code drift by comparing story data contracts, endpoints, and Gherkin scenarios against implemented code. Supports standalone mode (full report) and inline mode (compact output for TDD loop integration in x-story-implement Phase 2). |
| **x-status-reconcile** | `/x-status-reconcile` | Reconciles execution-state.json (telemetry) against the **Status:** field of Epic / Story markdown artifacts. Default mode (diagnose) is read-only and prints a divergence table. Opt-in --apply rewrites the markdowns atomically via StatusFieldParser and commits via x-git-commit. Respects Rule 19 (legacy v1 epics skip silently) and Rule 22 (markdown is SoT; state.json is telemetry). Use for manual recovery of legacy epics whose markdown status drifted from execution checkpoints. |
| **x-story-create** | `/x-story-create` | Generate detailed User Story files from an Epic and system specification with full data contracts, Gherkin acceptance criteria, Mermaid sequence diagrams, dependency declarations, tagged sub-tasks, quality gate validation, and optional Jira integration. |
| **x-story-implement** | `/x-story-implement` | Thin orchestrator (~320 lines — story-0049-0019 refactor) that drives a story end-to-end via 4 delegated phases: Phase 0 (args via x-internal-args-normalize + context via x-internal-story-load-context + resume via x-internal-story-resume), Phase 1 (parallel planning via x-internal-story-build-plan), Phase 2 (task execution loop via x-task-implement per task, then final story PR via x-pr-create), Phase 3 (verify via x-internal-story-verify + report via x-internal-story-report + optional worktree cleanup via x-git-worktree). New EPIC-0049 flags --target-branch / --auto-merge / --epic-id propagate OO-style to x-task-implement and x-pr-create. Backward compatible: absent flags preserve legacy EPIC-0048 behavior (target=develop, auto-merge=none). |
| **x-story-plan** | `/x-story-plan` | Multi-agent story planning: launches 5 specialized agents (Architect, QA, Security, Tech Lead, Product Owner) in parallel to produce a consolidated task breakdown, individual task plans, planning report, and DoR validation. Schema-aware: v1 (legacy) runs the original 6-phase flow; v2 (task-first, EPIC-0038) adds Phases 4a-4c that emit task-TASK-NNN.md + plan-task-TASK-NNN.md per task and a task-implementation-map-STORY-*.md, wiring every task through x-task-plan in parallel. |
| **x-supply-chain-audit** | `/x-supply-chain-audit` | Enhanced supply chain security audit beyond x-dependency-audit. Analyzes maintainer risk, typosquatting detection, phantom dependencies, dependency age, EPSS scoring, and SLSA assessment. Produces SARIF 2.1.0 output with weighted risk scoring. |
| **x-task-implement** | `/x-task-implement` | Implements a feature/story/task using TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) workflow. Schema-aware: v1 (legacy) runs the original Double-Loop TDD flow with story-section task extraction; v2 (task-first, EPIC-0038) reads task-TASK-XXXX-YYYY-NNN.md + plan-task-TASK-XXXX-YYYY-NNN.md, honours declared I/O contracts, respects task-implementation-map dependencies, verifies post-conditions via grep/assert, and produces a single atomic commit per task via x-git-commit. |
| **x-task-plan** | `/x-task-plan` | Generates a detailed per-task implementation plan (plan-task-TASK-XXXX-YYYY-NNN.md) with TDD cycles in TPP order, file impact analysis by architecture layer, security checklist by task type, and exit criteria. Two invocation modes: task-file-first (--task-file) consumes a standalone task-TASK-XXXX-YYYY-NNN.md contract (EPIC-0038); story-scoped (STORY-ID --task TASK-ID) reads the task from story Section 8 (legacy). Invocable standalone OR via x-story-plan (future). |
| **x-telemetry-analyze** | `/x-telemetry-analyze` | Analyze telemetry NDJSON for one or more epics and produce a Markdown report with skill/phase/tool aggregates, Mermaid Gantt timeline, and optional JSON/CSV exports. Use to answer 'which phase is the bottleneck?' and 'is skill X getting slower?' questions for operator visibility. |
| **x-telemetry-trend** | `/x-telemetry-trend` | Detect cross-epic P95 regressions (>= threshold %) and rank top-10 slowest skills from the global telemetry index. Single-responsibility partner of /x-telemetry-analyze focused on trend detection, not point-in-time reporting. Use to answer 'is skill X getting slower over the last N epics?' with evidence. |
| **x-test-contract-lint** | `/x-test-contract-lint` | Validates API contracts (OpenAPI 3.1, AsyncAPI 2.6, Protobuf 3) against their specifications. Reports structural errors, missing fields, and spec violations. |
| **x-test-e2e** | `/x-test-e2e` | Runs integration tests that validate the complete flow from request through all application layers to response, using a real database. |
| **x-test-plan** | `/x-test-plan` | Generates a Double-Loop TDD test plan with TPP-ordered scenarios before implementation. Delegates KP reading to a context-gathering subagent, then produces structured Acceptance Tests (outer loop) and Unit Tests in Transformation Priority Premise order (inner loop). |
| **x-test-run** | `/x-test-run` | Runs tests with coverage reporting and threshold validation. Use whenever writing, running, or analyzing tests. Triggers on: test, coverage, TDD, unit test, integration test, test failure, coverage gap, or Definition of Done validation. |
| **x-test-smoke-api** | `/x-test-smoke-api` | Runs automated smoke tests against the REST API using Newman/Postman. Supports local, container-orchestrated, and staging environments. |
| **x-test-tdd** | `/x-test-tdd` | Executes systematic Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycles for a task. Reads the task plan generated by x-task-plan, runs each cycle in TPP order, validates RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases, delegates atomic commits to x-git-commit with TDD tags, and supports resume and dry-run. |
| **x-threat-model** | `/x-threat-model` | Generate threat models using STRIDE analysis: identify components, map data flows, analyze threats per category, classify severity, suggest mitigations, and produce threat model document. |

**Total: 79 skills**

## Knowledge Packs (Internal Context)

Knowledge Packs do NOT appear in the `/` menu. They are referenced internally by agents and skills
to inject domain knowledge. Configured with `user-invocable: false`.

| Pack | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `planning-standards-kp` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-args-normalize` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-epic-branch-ensure` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-epic-build-plan` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-epic-integrity-gate` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-phase-gate` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-report-write` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-status-update` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-story-build-plan` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-story-load-context` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-story-report` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-story-resume` | Referenced internally by agents |
| `x-internal-story-verify` | Referenced internally by agents |

---

## Agents (AI Personas)

Agents are system prompts that define specialized personas. They are not invoked directly --
they are used by skills (via Task tool) to delegate work to agents with specific expertise.

| Agent | File |
|-------|------|
| **api-engineer** | `api-engineer.md` |
| **architect** | `architect.md` |
| **devops-engineer** | `devops-engineer.md` |
| **devsecops-engineer** | `devsecops-engineer.md` |
| **java-developer** | `java-developer.md` |
| **performance-engineer** | `performance-engineer.md` |
| **product-owner** | `product-owner.md` |
| **qa-engineer** | `qa-engineer.md` |
| **security-engineer** | `security-engineer.md` |
| **sre-engineer** | `sre-engineer.md` |
| **tech-lead** | `tech-lead.md` |

**Total: 11 agents**

---

## Hooks (Automations)

Hooks are scripts executed automatically in response to Claude Code events.
Configured in `settings.json` under the `hooks` key.

### Post-Compile Check

- **Event:** `PostToolUse` (after `Write` or `Edit`)
- **Script:** `.claude/hooks/post-compile-check.sh`
- **Behavior:** When a `.java` file is modified, runs `./gradlew compileJava -q` automatically
- **Purpose:** Catch compilation errors immediately after file changes

---

## Telemetry

Skill executions are captured as NDJSON under `plans/epic-*/telemetry/events.ndjson`, giving operators an auditable timeline of phase durations, subagent lifecycles, and tool calls. The architecture is documented in [ADR-0005 — Telemetry Architecture](../adr/ADR-0005-telemetry-architecture.md); the privacy contract lives in [Rule 20 — Telemetry Privacy](rules/20-telemetry-privacy.md).

Capture happens on two layers:

- **Hook-based (automatic).** Bash scripts under `hooks/` fire on `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStop`, and `Stop`. Registration is handled by `SettingsAssembler`.
- **In-skill phase markers.** Instrumented skills call `telemetry-phase.sh start|end` around each numbered phase. The authoring template `_TEMPLATE-SKILL.md` includes a "Telemetry (Optional)" section ready to copy.

Analysis skills:

```bash
# Point-in-time report (aggregates + Mermaid Gantt)
/x-telemetry-analyze --epic EPIC-0040

# Cross-epic P95 regression detector
/x-telemetry-trend --last 5 --threshold-pct 20
```

Opt out with `CLAUDE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (per-session) or by adding the nested YAML block below to the generator YAML (per-project, requires regeneration):

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```

EPIC-0040 shipped this stack — see the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for the release it landed in.

---

## Settings

### settings.json

Permissions are configured in `settings.json` under `permissions.allow`.
This controls which Bash commands Claude Code can run without asking.

### settings.local.json

Local overrides (gitignored). Use for personal preferences or team-specific tools.

See the files directly for current configuration.

## Artifact Conventions

| Artifact | Extension | Naming | Frontmatter |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Rules | `.md` | `NN-name.md` (numbered) | None |
| Skills | `SKILL.md` | `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | YAML (name, description) |
| Agents | `.md` | `{name}.md` | None |
| Hooks | `.sh` / `.json` | Event-based naming | N/A |

---

## Tips

- **Rules are always active** -- no need to invoke them, Claude already knows them.
- **Skills are lazy** -- they only load when you type `/name`.
- **Knowledge Packs do not appear in the `/` menu** -- they are internal context for agents.
- **Agents are not invoked directly** -- they are used by skills internally.
- **Hooks run automatically** -- compilation after editing source files detects errors early.
- **To create a new skill**: create `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` and it appears automatically.
- **To create a new rule**: add a `.md` file in `.claude/rules/` with the appropriate numbering.
- **Both directories are generated** -- run `ia-dev-env generate` to regenerate.
