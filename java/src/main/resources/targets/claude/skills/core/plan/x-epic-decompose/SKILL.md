## Output Policy

- **Language**: Portuguese (pt-BR) for all content. English for technical terms (cache, timeout, handler, endpoint) and code identifiers.
- **Tone**: Technical, Direct, and Concise.
- **Efficiency**: Remove all conversational fillers and greetings to save tokens.

# Skill: Spec-to-Stories Decomposition (Orchestrator)

## Purpose

Orchestrate the full decomposition of a system specification into three deliverables: an **Epic**, individual **Stories**, and an **Implementation Map**. Coordinate the work of three focused skills, each handling one deliverable.

## When to Use

- Decompose a spec into stories and epic
- Break down a system document into implementable work items
- Generate a complete project backlog from a specification
- Create epic, stories, and implementation plan from a technical document
- Full decomposition pipeline (epic + stories + map) in a single pass
- Prefer this skill over the individual `x-epic-create`, `x-story-create`, or `x-epic-map` skills when all three deliverables are needed

## Prerequisites

Read these files before starting:

**Templates (output structure) — read all three:**
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md` (RA9 v2: 9 sections)
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-STORY.md` (RA9 v2: 9 sections)
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`

**RA9 planning contract (source of truth for 9-section model):**
- `.claude/skills/planning-standards-kp/SKILL.md` — Defines all 9 RA9 sections, granularity per level (Epic/Story/Task), Packages catalog format, and Decision Rationale micro-template. Read before generating Sections 2 and 8.

**Decomposition philosophy:**
- `references/decomposition-guide.md` (bundled with this skill)

If any template is missing, stop and tell the user.

> **RA9 guidance (EPIC-0056):** For each generated Epic and Story, explicitly fill:
> - **Section 2 (Packages Hexagonal):** Map packages from spec analysis to the 5 hexagonal layers. Propagate epic-level catalog as subsets to each story.
> - **Section 8 (Decision Rationale):** Extract architectural decisions. Minimum 1 item per Epic/Story using the 4-line micro-template. Task accepts `N/A — <reason>`.

### Note on consolidated commit vs individual commits

Per story-0049-0021 Section 3.2, `x-epic-decompose` uses a **single consolidated commit** in Step P4 covering the full batch (epic + N stories + implementation map) rather than letting each sub-skill (`x-epic-create`, `x-story-create`, `x-epic-map`) commit individually. The sub-skills are called in this orchestrator with their own `--dry-run` effectively set — they WRITE the artifacts but do NOT invoke their own P4 / P5 steps (the orchestrator owns the commit). This yields `git log --oneline` containing one audit-trail entry per decomposition instead of N+2, matching the operator expectation that `x-epic-decompose foo --spec bar.md` is a single logical mutation.

## Decomposition Philosophy

Before generating anything, read `references/decomposition-guide.md`. It explains the
layer-by-layer approach that drives the entire decomposition:

- **Layer 0 (Foundation)**: Infrastructure — servers, schemas, APIs, protocol adapters
- **Layer 1 (Core Domain)**: The central operation establishing architectural patterns
- **Layer 2 (Extensions)**: Additional operations reusing core patterns
- **Layer 3 (Compositions)**: Stories combining multiple extension capabilities
- **Layer 4 (Cross-Cutting)**: Testing, observability, security, tech debt

The guide also covers:
- How to identify story boundaries (1 endpoint = 1 story, 1 protocol flow = 1 story)
- Dependency mapping (structural, data, pattern dependencies)
- Phase computation (DAG-based, parallel within phases)
- Sizing heuristics (too big, too small, just right)

## Phase P1 — Detect Worktree Context (EPIC-0049 / RULE-001)

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-P1-Worktree-Detect`

Invoke `x-git-worktree detect-context` so subsequent phases know whether the current checkout is already inside an epic worktree.

    Skill(skill: "x-git-worktree", args: "detect-context")

Fail-open (RULE-006): any detect-context failure is logged and Phase P2 proceeds.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-P1-Worktree-Detect ok`

## Phase P2 — Ensure `epic/<ID>` Branch (EPIC-0049 / RULE-001)

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-P2-Epic-Branch-Ensure`

Resolve the effective epic ID (next-available auto-increment when not supplied, as in Phase 2 below), then ensure the canonical `epic/<ID>` branch exists locally AND on origin:

    Skill(skill: "x-internal-epic-branch-ensure", args: "--epic-id <XXXX>")

Abort with `EPIC_BRANCH_ENSURE_FAILED` on any non-zero exit — a consolidated audit trail cannot be produced without the canonical branch.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-P2-Epic-Branch-Ensure ok`

## Phase 1 — Analysis

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-1-Analysis`

1. Ask the user which spec file to process (or use the one they provided)
2. Read the entire spec file
3. Read `references/decomposition-guide.md`
4. Analyze the spec:
   - Identify cross-cutting rules (rules that span multiple journeys)
   - Identify stories by layer (foundation → core → extensions → compositions → cross-cutting)
   - Map dependencies between stories
   - Compute phases from the dependency DAG
   - Identify the critical path

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-1-Analysis ok`

## Phase 1.5 — Jira Integration Decision

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-1_5-Jira-Decision`

Before generating any artifacts, determine if Jira integration is desired.

### 1.5.1 — Check MCP Availability

Verify that the Jira MCP tool (`mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue`) is available.
If the tool is NOT available, set `jiraContext = { enabled: false }` and skip to
Phase 2 silently — do not warn the user.

### 1.5.1b — Roteamento por Flag (EPIC-0042)

Antes de prompt ao usuario, verificar as flags de Jira:

- Se `--no-jira` estiver presente: definir `jiraContext = { enabled: false }` e pular
  para a Phase 2. Log: `"Jira integration skipped (--no-jira, EPIC-0042)"`

- Se `--jira <PROJECT_KEY>` estiver presente: usar a chave de projeto fornecida
  diretamente. Pular AskUserQuestion (Step 1.5.2). Descobrir o `cloudId` chamando
  `mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources`. Usar o `id` do primeiro site
  disponivel como `cloudId`. Se a chamada falhar ou nao retornar sites, alertar o
  usuario e definir `jiraContext = { enabled: false }`. Caso contrario, definir
  `jiraContext = { enabled: true, cascadeToStories: true, projectKey: "<PROJECT_KEY>", cloudId: "<cloudId>" }`.
  Log: `"Jira integration via --jira flag: project {PROJECT_KEY}, cascade to stories (EPIC-0042)"`
  Pular para a Phase 2.

- Se nenhuma flag estiver presente: prosseguir para o Step 1.5.2 (prompt interativo
  compativel com a versao anterior).

### 1.5.2 — Ask the User (no flags provided)

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

```
question: "Deseja criar o épico e as histórias no Jira?"
header: "Jira"
options:
  - label: "Sim, criar tudo no Jira"
    description: "Criar o épico e TODAS as histórias como issues no Jira automaticamente via MCP"
  - label: "Apenas o épico no Jira"
    description: "Criar somente o épico no Jira. As histórias serão apenas markdown"
  - label: "Não, apenas markdown"
    description: "Gerar apenas os arquivos markdown sem integração com Jira"
multiSelect: false
```

### 1.5.3 — Build jiraContext

Based on user selection:

- **"Sim, criar tudo no Jira"**:
  1. Ask for the Jira project key using AskUserQuestion:
     ```
     question: "Qual a chave do projeto Jira? (ex: PROJ, MYAPP, TEAM)"
     header: "Projeto"
     ```
  2. Discover the `cloudId` by calling `mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources`.
     Use the first available site's `id` as the `cloudId`. If the call fails or returns
     no sites, warn the user and set `jiraContext = { enabled: false }`.
  3. Set `jiraContext = { enabled: true, cascadeToStories: true, projectKey: "<key>", cloudId: "<cloudId>" }`

- **"Apenas o épico no Jira"**:
  1. Ask for the Jira project key (same as above)
  2. Discover the `cloudId` (same as above)
  3. Set `jiraContext = { enabled: true, cascadeToStories: false, projectKey: "<key>", cloudId: "<cloudId>" }`

- **"Não, apenas markdown"**:
  1. Set `jiraContext = { enabled: false }`

The `jiraContext` is passed to all subsequent phases and used to control Jira issue creation.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-1_5-Jira-Decision ok`

## Phase 2 — Generate the Epic

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-2-Epic`

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-epic-create/SKILL.md`:

- Determine the epic number (scan `plans/` for existing `epic-XXXX` folders, use next available; default `0001`)
- Create directory `plans/epic-XXXX/`
- Extract rules → RULE-001..N table
- Build story index with titles and dependencies (using `story-XXXX-YYYY` IDs)
- Define DoR/DoD from spec quality requirements — the DoD must include TDD Compliance (test-first commits, explicit refactoring after green, incremental tests via TPP) and Double-Loop TDD (acceptance tests from Gherkin as outer loop, unit tests as inner loop)
- Generate `plans/epic-XXXX/epic-XXXX.md` following `_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md`

**Jira Integration (if `jiraContext.enabled == true`):**

After generating the Epic markdown file:
1. Call `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` to create an Epic issue:
   - `cloudId`: `jiraContext.cloudId`
   - `projectKey`: `jiraContext.projectKey`
   - `issueTypeName`: "Epic"
   - `summary`: The Epic title (from the generated header)
   - `description`: The "Visão Geral" section text
   - `contentFormat`: "markdown"
   - `additional_fields`: `{ "labels": [{ "name": "generated-by-ia-dev-env" }, { "name": "epic-XXXX" }] }` (where `epic-XXXX` is the local ID for bidirectional sync)
2. Capture the returned Jira issue key (e.g., "PROJ-123")
3. Update `jiraContext.epicIssueKey` with the returned key
4. Replace `<CHAVE-JIRA>` in the generated Epic markdown with the actual Jira key
5. If creation fails: warn the user, set `<CHAVE-JIRA>` to `EPIC-XXXX (Jira: falha na criação)`,
   leave `jiraContext.epicIssueKey` absent (do NOT set it to an empty string or invalid value),
   and continue. In Phase 3, stories will be created without a `parent` link when
   `jiraContext.epicIssueKey` is absent, maintaining non-blocking behavior

If `jiraContext.enabled == false`: replace `<CHAVE-JIRA>` with `—` in the Epic markdown.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-2-Epic ok`

## Phase 3 — Generate the Stories

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-3-Stories`

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-story-create/SKILL.md`:

For each story in the Epic's index:
- Dependencies (Blocked By / Blocks) — must be symmetric
- Applicable rules (reference Epic rules by ID)
- User story description + technical context
- **Entrega de Valor (Section 3.5)** — measurable business value from the business perspective
  (NOT technical tasks — see x-story-create Section 3.5 rules for FORBIDDEN/REQUIRED patterns)
- Data contracts (precise: field names, types, formats, derivation rules)
- Mermaid sequence diagrams (real component names from the spec)
- Gherkin acceptance criteria with mandatory categories (degenerate case, happy path, error paths, boundary values) ordered by Transformation Priority Premise (simplest degenerate → complex edge cases)
- Sub-tasks tagged `[Dev]`, `[Test]`, `[Doc]` — MUST include at least one `[Test] Smoke/E2E` sub-task

Generate files as `plans/epic-XXXX/story-XXXX-YYYY.md` following `_TEMPLATE-STORY.md`.

**Jira Integration (if `jiraContext.cascadeToStories == true`):**

Pass `jiraContext` to the story generation logic. For each generated story:
1. Call `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` to create a Story issue:
   - `cloudId`: `jiraContext.cloudId`
   - `projectKey`: `jiraContext.projectKey`
   - `issueTypeName`: "Story"
   - `summary`: The story title
   - `description`: The user story text from Section 3 (the "Como **Persona**..." paragraph)
   - `contentFormat`: "markdown"
   - `parent`: `jiraContext.epicIssueKey` (links the story to the parent epic) — include only if `jiraContext.epicIssueKey` is present; omit entirely when absent
   - `additional_fields`: `{ "labels": [{ "name": "generated-by-ia-dev-env" }, { "name": "story-XXXX-YYYY" }] }` (where `story-XXXX-YYYY` is the local story ID for bidirectional sync)
2. Replace `<CHAVE-JIRA>` in the story markdown with the returned Jira key
3. If creation fails for a story: warn, set `<CHAVE-JIRA>` to `—`, continue with remaining stories

If `jiraContext.cascadeToStories == false` or `jiraContext.enabled == false`:
replace `<CHAVE-JIRA>` with `—` in all story markdowns.

No additional `AskUserQuestion` is needed — the cascade decision was already made in Phase 1.5.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-3-Stories ok`

## Phase 4 — Generate the Implementation Map

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-4-Map`

Follow the instructions in `.claude/skills/x-epic-map/SKILL.md`:

- Dependency matrix (all stories, validated for consistency)
- Phase diagram (ASCII box-drawing)
- Critical path analysis
- Mermaid dependency graph (color-coded by phase)
- Phase summary and detail tables
- Strategic observations (bottleneck, leaves, parallelism, convergences, validation milestone)

Generate `plans/epic-XXXX/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` following `_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`.

If Jira keys are available (from Phase 3), include them in the dependency matrix's
`Chave Jira` column.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-4-Map ok`

## Phase 4.5 — Jira Dependency Linking (if applicable)

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-4_5-Jira-Links`

If `jiraContext.enabled == true` and `jiraContext.cascadeToStories == true`, and all
stories have Jira keys:

1. For each story, read its "Blocked By" list
2. For each blocker that has a Jira key, call `mcp__atlassian__createIssueLink`:
   - `cloudId`: `jiraContext.cloudId`
   - `type`: "Blocks"
   - `inwardIssue`: the blocker's Jira key (the issue that blocks)
   - `outwardIssue`: the current story's Jira key (the issue that is blocked)
3. Report: "N dependency links criados no Jira"

If linking fails for some stories, log warnings but do not fail the pipeline.
This step is best-effort — Jira links are a convenience, not a hard requirement.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-4_5-Jira-Links ok`

## Phase P4 — Consolidated Planning Commit (EPIC-0049 / RULE-007)

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-P4-Consolidated-Commit`

If `--dry-run` is set, log `"dry-run, skipping commit"` and skip this phase entirely.

Otherwise, collect the full path set produced by Phases 2, 3, and 4 (epic file + all story files + implementation map + any templates newly written) and issue a **single consolidated commit** via `x-planning-commit`:

    Skill(skill: "x-planning-commit",
          args: "--scope chore --epic-id <XXXX> --paths plans/epic-<XXXX>/epic-<XXXX>.md,plans/epic-<XXXX>/story-<XXXX>-0001.md,...,plans/epic-<XXXX>/IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md --subject \"full decomposition (epic + <N> stories + map)\"")

Rationale for consolidation over per-sub-skill commits (see Workflow Overview note above): the operator experiences `x-epic-decompose` as one logical mutation; history reads as `chore(epic-XXXX): full decomposition (epic + 22 stories + map)` rather than 24 interleaved commits.

Idempotency: re-running an identical decomposition yields `commitSha=null` + `noOp=true` from `x-planning-commit`. No additional diff check is required in this phase.

On `COMMIT_FAILED` (exit 4 from `x-planning-commit`), abort with the same error code.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-P4-Consolidated-Commit ok`

## Phase P5 — Push to Origin (optional, EPIC-0049)

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-P5-Push`

If `--dry-run` is set, log `"dry-run, skipping push"` and skip.

Otherwise, push the canonical epic branch so the full decomposition is observable on origin:

    Skill(skill: "x-git-push", args: "--branch epic/<XXXX>")

On push failure, log a WARNING and continue. Do NOT abort — the local commit is preserved.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-P5-Push ok`

## Phase 5 — Save and Report

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.start -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh start x-epic-decompose Phase-5-Report`

All files are saved inside `plans/epic-XXXX/` (the epic's dedicated folder).

Report summary:
- Total rules extracted
- Total stories generated
- Total phases computed
- Critical path length (phases and stories)
- Maximum parallelism (largest phase)
- Main bottleneck (story blocking the most others)

If Jira integration was active, also report:
- Jira integration: Enabled (project: `<PROJECT_KEY>`)
- Epic created in Jira: `<JIRA-KEY>` (or "falha" if failed)
- Stories created in Jira: N of M (successful/total)
- Dependency links created: K
- Failures: list any failed items

### Quality Validation (before completing Phase 5)

Before reporting, validate that all generated artifacts meet these quality gates:

- [ ] Every story has a "Entrega de Valor" section (Section 3.5) with measurable business value
- [ ] Every story has at least one smoke/automated test sub-task `[Test] Smoke/E2E` in Section 8
- [ ] Every story DoD Local includes automated test requirement
- [ ] Stories are decomposed around business value, not technical layers (SD-10 compliance)
- [ ] Story template includes `**Status:** Pendente` field in the header
- [ ] "Entrega de Valor" column is populated in the Epic Index (Section 5)
- [ ] Epic labels in Jira include local ID (e.g., `epic-XXXX`) for bidirectional sync
- [ ] Story labels in Jira include local ID (e.g., `story-XXXX-YYYY`) for bidirectional sync

If any story fails validation, fix it before saving. Do not skip validation.

<!-- TELEMETRY: phase.end -->
Bash command: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/telemetry-phase.sh end x-epic-decompose Phase-5-Report ok`

## Language Rules

- All generated content must be in **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)**
- Technical terms in English stay in English (cache, timeout, handler, endpoint, etc.)
- Code identifiers, field names, enum values stay in English
- Gherkin in Portuguese: `Cenario`, `DADO`, `QUANDO`, `ENTÃO`, `E`, `MAS`
- IDs: RULE-NNN (English format), story-XXXX-YYYY (composite), epic-XXXX (kebab-case)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Spec file not found or empty | Abort with message: `Spec file not found or is empty. Provide a valid path.` |
| Template file missing (`_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md`, `_TEMPLATE-STORY.md`, or `_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`) | Stop and tell the user which template is missing |
| Jira MCP tool unavailable | Set `jiraContext = { enabled: false }`, skip Jira integration silently |
| Jira Epic creation fails | Warn the user, set `<CHAVE-JIRA>` to `EPIC-XXXX (Jira: falha na criacao)`, continue |
| Jira Story creation fails for a story | Warn, set `<CHAVE-JIRA>` to `—` for that story, continue with remaining stories |
| Circular dependency detected in story graph | Abort with message listing the cycle and affected stories |
| Story fails quality validation (Phase 5) | Fix the story before saving — do not skip validation |
| `x-internal-epic-branch-ensure` fails (Phase P2) | Abort with `EPIC_BRANCH_ENSURE_FAILED`; canonical branch is required for the consolidated commit |
| `x-planning-commit` exit 4 (Phase P4) | Abort with `COMMIT_FAILED`; artifacts written but not versioned |
| `x-planning-commit` exit 0 + `noOp=true` (Phase P4) | Silent no-op — re-execution idempotency confirmed; continue to Phase P5 |
| `x-git-push` fails (Phase P5) | WARN only; local commit preserved; operator re-runs manually |
| `--dry-run` set | Phases P4 and P5 become no-ops with log line `"dry-run, skipping commit"` / `"dry-run, skipping push"` |

## Template Fallback

This skill requires all three templates (`_TEMPLATE-EPIC.md`, `_TEMPLATE-STORY.md`, `_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`). Unlike other orchestrators, there is no graceful fallback — missing templates halt execution because the output format is strictly defined.

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Every rule in the Epic is referenced by at least one story
- [ ] Every story references at least one rule (except infrastructure stories)
- [ ] Dependencies are symmetric (A blocks B ↔ B blocked by A)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Phase computation is correct (stories only enter phase when ALL deps are in earlier phases)
- [ ] Critical path is the actual longest chain (not just the deepest phase)
- [ ] Data contracts match the spec exactly (field names, types, formats)
- [ ] Each story has at least 4 Gherkin scenarios covering all mandatory categories (degenerate, happy path, error paths, boundary values), ordered by TPP (degenerate → edge cases)
- [ ] Epic DoD includes TDD Compliance and Double-Loop TDD
- [ ] Boundary values use triplet pattern (at-min, at-max, past-max)
- [ ] Implementation map observations are specific, not generic
- [ ] All files follow their respective templates exactly

## Planning Status Propagation (Rule 22 / EPIC-0046)

> V2-gated: only runs when the decomposed epic declares `planningSchemaVersion: "2.0"` (seeded into the generated `execution-state.json`). For v1 epics: skip silently (Rule 19).

`x-epic-decompose` produces (a) the epic, (b) N story files, and (c) the `implementation-map-XXXX.md`. Lifecycle semantics:

- **Epic:** transitions from `Em Refinamento` → `Pendente` at the end of decomposition (decomposition is complete, ready for planning).
- **Stories:** created with `**Status:** Pendente` (they start unplanned).
- **implementation-map:** the `Planejamento` column is populated with the literal value `Pendente` for every story row (template token `{{PLANNING_STATUS}}` resolved at render-time to the real string `Pendente`).

**Steps (final phase of decomposition, before the commit):**

1. Detect v2 via the epic's seeded `execution-state.json`. If v1: skip.
2. For the epic file, transition its status:
   ```bash
   java -cp $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/java/target/classes \
       dev.iadev.adapter.inbound.cli.StatusFieldParserCli \
       write plans/epic-XXXX/epic-XXXX.md Pendente
   ```
   Note: `LifecycleTransitionMatrix` does NOT currently list `Em Refinamento` (it is a pre-lifecycle marker). If the CLI returns exit 40 because the current status is `Em Refinamento` (not in the 6-value enum), treat that as the accepted initial state and proceed: re-invoke with a direct file edit fallback (sed-replace the line) when and only when the current literal is `Em Refinamento`. Otherwise respect exit 40 and abort.
3. For each generated story file, verify the literal `**Status:** Pendente` is present (`StatusFieldParserCli read` returns `Pendente`). Exit 0 required per story; exit 20 on any story aborts the decomposition.
4. In the `implementation-map-XXXX.md` template, replace every `{{PLANNING_STATUS}}` placeholder with `Pendente`.
5. Stage the epic, all stories, and the implementation map; commit with `x-git-commit`:

       Skill(skill: "x-git-commit", args: "docs(epic-XXXX): decompose — epic Pendente, N stories, implementation map")

**Fail-loud:** any story missing or malformed → abort (RULE-046-08).
