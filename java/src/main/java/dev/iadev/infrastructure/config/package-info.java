/**
 * Composition Root — manual dependency wiring.
 *
 * <p>This package is the single place where all dependencies are assembled. It creates concrete
 * adapter instances, injects them into domain services, and exposes fully-wired use case
 * implementations to the CLI layer.
 *
 * <p><strong>Dependency restrictions (RULE-005):</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>MAY depend on ALL packages (domain, application, infrastructure adapters)
 *   <li>This is the ONLY package allowed to instantiate concrete adapter implementations
 *   <li>Domain and application packages MUST NOT depend on this package
 * </ul>
