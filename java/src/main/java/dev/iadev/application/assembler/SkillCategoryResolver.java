/**
 * Resolves skill names and source paths across the EPIC-0036 category-aware source-of-truth layout.
 *
 * <p>Extracted from {@code SkillsAssembler} (audit M-002) so the "skill lives in a category
 * subfolder, output is flat" mapping is a single-responsibility helper with its own test surface.
 * Under EPIC-0036, skills physically live under one level of category subfolders (e.g. {@code
 * core/plan/x-epic-create/SKILL.md}) but emit to the flat output path {@code
 * .claude/skills/{name}/}. The {@code lib/} subtree is the one exception — it keeps its {@code
 * lib/} prefix in the emitted name.
 *
 * <p>This class is a thin adapter over {@link SkillsHierarchyResolver}: it provides the root-aware
 * operations callers need (list skills under a root, resolve the on-disk path of a named skill)
 * while keeping the low-level traversal logic single-sourced.
